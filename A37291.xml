            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is ſet in order of <hi>place</hi> before all other his Epiſtles; not becauſe it was before all the other in order of <hi>time,</hi> but becauſe it was written unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe City at that time <hi>excelled</hi> all other Cities in dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and in preheminence of Rule and Dominion; for if we look to the order of time in which they were written, both the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were written before this to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap.</hi> 8. and 9. Stirreth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> up to a liberall contribution for the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> But in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Ver.</hi> 25, 26. He telleth the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>he was to go to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to miniſter unto the Saints; for it had pleaſed them of</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia (part of which was <hi>Corinth) to make a certain contribution, for the poor Saints which were at</hi> Jeruſalem. This contribution therefore was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected then, when he wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was not made when he wrote to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and therefore his Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in order of time written before his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> though his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> hath in order of place, the Priority before his Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle in <hi>the Greek tongue,</hi> though he wrote to <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whoſe language was the <hi>Latine;</hi> Becauſe the <hi>principle Subject</hi> or Argument of this Epiſtle, was not <hi>ſome occaſional</hi> matter, as the <hi>Subject</hi> or Argument of other his Epiſtles was; but <hi>ſuch</hi> a Subject, or <hi>ſuch</hi> an Argument, in which there was <hi>no Church,</hi> but was concerned. For the <hi>principle</hi> Subject or Argument of this Epiſtle conteins in a manner <hi>the ſum</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt. And therefore, though he dedicates it, as it were, to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> which were at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the head City of all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and from thence by the frequency of men of all Nations, and Countries reſorting thither, the truth might be carried and ſpread abroad, among other people, yet is it likely that he did intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to <hi>other Churches</hi> alſo, and to ſend them <hi>Copies</hi> thereof, for their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and confirmation: And for ſuch a <hi>purpoſe,</hi> it was more ſuteable to write in the <hi>Greek tongue,</hi> then in the <hi>Latine.</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> was the tongue, which was then moſt <hi>generally</hi> known and uſed, which even the <hi>Roman</hi> women could ſpeak, and by which Strangers and Travellers had commerce with, and underſtanding one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: But the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue (though it be <hi>now</hi> the tongue moſt <hi>generally</hi> learned and known, yet) was it at that time confined within <hi>narrow</hi> limits, and not a <hi>generall</hi> language; which <hi>Tully</hi> confeſſeth in his Oration, <hi>pro Archia Poeta.</hi> For <hi>Graeca</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leguntur in omnibus fere Gentibus, Latina ſuis finibus, exiguis ſanè, continentur.</hi> That is, <hi>The Greek writings are read almoſt in all Nations, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine are contained within their own bounds, and thoſe but ſmall ones too.</hi> But of this, See more in <hi>Brerewoods Enquiries touching the diverſity of Languages, Chap.</hi> 1. and 3.</p>

               <p>He teacheth that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is not by the works of the Law, for that <hi>all had ſinned,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And this, that <hi>all had ſinned,</hi> he ſhews, as to the <hi>Gentiles, Chap.</hi> 1. from <hi>verſe</hi> 19. to the end of that Chapter; And as to the <hi>Jews</hi> he ſheweth it <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and 3. from the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter, to the <hi>one and twentieth</hi> of the <hi>third.</hi> And by the way he ſheweth alſo, that a <hi>Jew</hi> is not <hi>juſtified,</hi> neither as he is <hi>a Jew</hi> according to the fleſh; neither as he <hi>hath the Law</hi> and <hi>the knowledge</hi> thereof; neither as he is <hi>circumciſed;</hi> and having ſhewed both of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that they have <hi>all</hi> of them ſinned; he concludes that therefore <hi>by the deeds of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in the ſight of God,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 20. Then <hi>verſe</hi> 21. He ſhews, <hi>That Juſtification is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi>

That is, ſuch as <hi>were contentious againſt the Goſpel, and obeyed not, or believed not that Word of Truth, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> againſt whom <hi>indignation and wrath is revealed.</hi>) He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts <hi>the great</hi> heavineſs and <hi>continual</hi> ſorrow, which he had in his heart. For <hi>thoſe Jews</hi> which were his <hi>Kinſmen</hi> according to the fleſh, and to whom (among many other priviledges) the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God did belong, <hi>to think,</hi> that they reſiſting that way, which <hi>God</hi> had <hi>appointed,</hi> for obtaining Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification, <hi>ſhould</hi> invent another way of their own, and go about to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> that their <hi>own</hi> way, and <hi>ſubmit</hi> not, or <hi>yield</hi> not to follow that way of Righteouſneſs, which <hi>God</hi> had <hi>preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> And <hi>this heavineſs</hi> and continual ſorrow of his heart for them, he doth ſhew that they <hi>conſidering</hi> and contemplating <hi>his</hi> ſorrow for them, might <hi>pity</hi> their own ſelves, and <hi>embrace</hi> the truth, that they might <hi>be ſaved</hi> at the laſt.</p>
               <p>But though he <hi>manifesteth</hi> here the great heavineſs, and continuall ſorrow, which he had in heart, for thoſe his <hi>Kinſmen, to wit, the Jewes,</hi> yet <hi>he doth not</hi> here <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> of this his ſorrow, being <hi>interrupted</hi> with an objection, which might ariſe from what he had ſaid, and to which he would anſwer, but deferreth it to the <hi>next</hi> Chapter and there reſumeth, and perfecteth, what he here <hi>broke off,</hi> though in other terms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objection</hi> which might ariſe from what he had ſad, is this.

To this objection <hi>Saint Paul</hi> anſwers here <hi>verſes</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. to this effect. <hi>True</hi> it is, that God made a <hi>promiſe</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that he would <hi>juſtifie</hi> them, but whereas there are <hi>to</hi> ſorts of <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> one which are <hi>Iſraelites</hi> according <hi>to the Fleſh,</hi> which deſcended from <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>carnall</hi> propagation.

                  <pb facs="tcp:59465:5"/> in this Faith (for <hi>they which are of Faith, they are the Children of Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.7.) <hi>That</hi> promiſe of <hi>Juſtification</hi> doth belong <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>immediately, not</hi> to thoſe, which are the Children of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Such;</hi> but to <hi>thoſe</hi> which <hi>believe, as Such;</hi> and ſo are the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whether they be <hi>Jewes,</hi> or whether they be <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, becauſe the ſame or another <hi>Jew</hi> might <hi>reply</hi> upon this, and ſay. <hi>Yea,</hi> but for all thy ſaying <hi>(Paul) though I ſhould grant,</hi> that that <hi>promiſe</hi> doth not belong to us Jewes, as we are the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the <hi>Fleſh, as Such,</hi> yet ſurely it doth appertain to us: as we <hi>ſeek juſtification by the works of the Law,</hi> and we <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> be juſtified by ſo doing.</p>
               <p>To this objection the Apoſtle anſwers <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. to this effect. <hi>No,</hi> neither ſhall ye <hi>be juſtified</hi> for this, neither; which may be <hi>proved</hi> by that, which God ſaid unto <hi>Rebecca,</hi> while ſhe had <hi>two</hi> Twins <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the heads of <hi>two</hi> People in her womb: For at that time, when <hi>the Children</hi> were <hi>not</hi> yet born, <hi>before</hi> they had done either good or evil, <hi>he</hi> ſaid unto her, <hi>The Elder ſhall ſerve the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> and <hi>this God</hi> ſaid to her at <hi>that time</hi> to <hi>ſignifie</hi> in a type, that <hi>his purpoſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>his actual Electing</hi> men to <hi>Juſtification</hi> (which <hi>Election</hi> is performed <hi>in time,</hi> by <hi>juſtifying</hi> them) was and ſhould be <hi>to elect</hi> or <hi>juſtifie</hi> them, <hi>not</hi> for their <hi>workes</hi> ſake (for which <hi>no</hi> man can be <hi>juſtified,</hi> and <hi>if</hi> he could he might <hi>claim</hi> juſtification of <hi>debt,</hi>) but for his <hi>own</hi> Mercy and Grace ſake, who <hi>calleth</hi> us by the preaching of his Goſpel, that we may <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> may be <hi>juſtified,</hi> and hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that to be our way for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>a Jew</hi> would be apt to ſay, that if it were ſo as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Viz. That God would not juſtifie a Jew, though he were a Jew by birth, and though he did more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſeek juſtification by works, if he believed not;</hi> and yet <hi>would</hi> juſtifie every one which <hi>believeth,</hi> though he were a <hi>Gentile:</hi> Then there would be unrighteouſneſs with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Paul</hi> takes away this objection, ſhewing <hi>firſt,</hi> That there is <hi>no</hi> unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs with God, <hi>in juſtifying</hi> thoſe which <hi>believe,</hi> though they be <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for he may <hi>juſtly have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> ver. 15. And (by the by, <hi>ver.</hi> 16) he ſhews them, <hi>who being ignorant of Gods way of Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification, went about to eſtabliſh a way of their own,</hi> that it was <hi>not</hi> in them, who <hi>choſe</hi> a way of Righteouſneſs or Juſtification of their <hi>own,</hi> though they were <hi>zealous</hi> in that way, and run <hi>earneſtly</hi> in it, to <hi>attain</hi> to Juſtification: but it was <hi>onely</hi> in God, <hi>who</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy <hi>to whom</hi> he will, and <hi>to what way</hi> he will. <hi>Then,</hi> as he had ſhewed, <hi>that there</hi> was <hi>no</hi> unrighteouſneſs in God, if he did <hi>juſtifie</hi> thoſe which did <hi>believe,</hi> though they were <hi>Gentiles:</hi> He ſhewes, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. by the <hi>Example</hi> which God ſhewed upon <hi>Pharaoh, that</hi> there is <hi>no</hi> unrighteouſneſs in God, <hi>if</hi> he did <hi>not</hi> juſtifie a <hi>Jew,</hi> though he were a <hi>Jew by birth,</hi> and ſought Juſtification <hi>by works, if he believed not;</hi> And <hi>concludeth,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>That God doth juſtly justifie whom he will, and doth juſtly deny ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to whom he will,</hi> yea, and harden them too.</p>
               <p>And now being, that <hi>God</hi> doth every where <hi>complain</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> to deſtroy them, for the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of their heart: A <hi>malepart Jew</hi> ſtarts up, and hearing <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that <hi>God hardeneth whom he will,</hi> Sayes: But if God <hi>hardeneth</hi> whom he will, why doth he now <hi>find fault</hi> with us and <hi>threatneth</hi> us for our <hi>hardneſs</hi> of heart? For it is <hi>he</hi> that hardneth <hi>whom</hi> he will; and if <hi>he</hi> will <hi>harden</hi> us, how can we help it? are we able to <hi>reſiſt</hi> him? To this objectian made <hi>verſe</hi> 19. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>firſt</hi> by rebuking the Objector, for his <hi>Saucineſs,</hi> who <hi>dares</hi> to chop Logick thus with God, <hi>verſe</hi> 20, 21. Then <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23. he gives a more <hi>direct</hi> anſwer, by which he ſhews that God did <hi>harden</hi> them <hi>onely occaſionally,</hi> in that he did <hi>not cut them off,</hi> but did <hi>endure</hi> them with much <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> by which <hi>thoſe veſſels of wrath,</hi> that is, <hi>they which were contentious, and obeyed not the truth, but obeyed unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fitted</hi> themſelves for <hi>deſtruction;</hi> for though by his <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> God <hi>led them to repentance,</hi> yet they by the <hi>abuſe</hi> thereof, contracted <hi>hardneſs,</hi> and an <hi>impoenitent hearts</hi> upon themſelves, <hi>heaping up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and Revelation of the Righteous judgement of God;</hi> and therefore there was no <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> in God,
<pb facs="tcp:59465:5"/> if he being <hi>willing to ſhew his wrath</hi> upon thoſe veſſels of wrath if they would not repent, he found fault with them when they repented not. And if by <hi>ſo</hi> doing he ſhewed the abundance of his <hi>goodneſs</hi> alſo, to <hi>the veſſels of mercy</hi> by juſtifying them, and ſo <hi>preparing</hi> them to glory, as he had before determined. Which veſſels of mercy he ſhews. <hi>verſe</hi> 24. to be <hi>them,</hi> which <hi>believe,</hi> not of the <hi>Jswes</hi> onely, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. Then to confirm what he had ſaid concerning thoſe diſobedient <hi>Jews,</hi> and the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he brings divers teſtimonies out of the Scriptures, <hi>verſes</hi> 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

But <hi>the Jewes</hi> for the greateſt part of them, miſſed of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> becauſe <hi>they ſought it not by Faith, but by the works of the Law.</hi> And ſo having made way to that, which he left <hi>imperfect</hi> at the ſixth verſe of this Chapter.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. Saith that <hi>in the Epiſtle, which</hi> Paul <hi>wrote to the Jews, as alſo in all other his Epiſtles, there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they which are unlearned and unſtable wreſt as they do all other Scriptures unto their own</hi> deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>this</hi> Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be the <hi>peculiar</hi> Epiſtle, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> meant, by that which Saint <hi>Paul wrote</hi> to the Jewes (as ſome would have it:) Or whether the Epiſtle, to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (as others) or no. <hi>Sure</hi> it is, that in <hi>this</hi> Epiſtle of his to the Romans, there be ſome things <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> and there be things, <hi>which they which are unlearned and unſtable, have wreſted to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For becauſe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> declares in this his Epiſtle, that <hi>Juſtification is not by the workes of the Law,</hi> but <hi>by Faith</hi> and ſo by <hi>Grace</hi> (to omit many other errors, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collected out of <hi>other</hi> paſſages of this his Epiſtle <hi>not well underſtood</hi>) ſome have contented themſelves with the <hi>empty</hi> name of <hi>Faith,</hi> as though that were <hi>enough,</hi> not only to <hi>Juſtifie</hi> them, but to <hi>ſave</hi> them, and have altogether <hi>neglected</hi> good workes, and even <hi>fought</hi> againſt them. For that there were thoſe even in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, which taught that a <hi>barren Faith</hi> which produceth not works, was <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>We may learn both from <hi>Saint James,</hi> and from <hi>Saint Jude</hi> in their Epiſtles, and <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> ſheweth as much, in his book <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nico Baptiſmo contra Petilianum, Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Tom.</hi> 7, <hi>page</hi> 85. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>A. This was</hi> Simon Magus's <hi>doctrine,</hi> or <hi>wicked hereſie</hi> rather, and the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>hereſie</hi> of his Diſciples called from him <hi>Simoniani,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Menandrians, Baſilidians, Gnoſticks, Manichees, Aetians,</hi> and <hi>Eunomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: All</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> of which did willingly embrace <hi>all</hi> manner of ſin, and turpitude, as the <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>grace</hi> of God, by which we are ſaved. Such <hi>Hereticks</hi> did the ages following bring forth; and to <hi>Skip</hi> to later times, ſuch were, and are they, which are called <hi>Antinomians,</hi> whoſe Tenets concerning <hi>good works</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe. <hi>That the Law is not given to Chriſtians. That the ten Commandments ought not to be taught in Churches. That it is ſufficient for a wicked man to believe, and not to doubt of his Salvation. That neither good works profit to Salvation, neither ill workes do no hurt. That to ſay that the Law is a rule of life, is blaſphemy in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp;c.</hi> Then which <hi>nothing</hi> can be more <hi>deſtructive</hi> of a man's Salvation; and theſe their <hi>Hereſies</hi> they drew from the miſunderſtanding of Saint <hi>Pauls words,</hi> in this his Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, there are many things, which are <hi>hard</hi> to be underſtood, for the <hi>better</hi> underſtanding of this Epiſtle, it will be <hi>expedient</hi> to know,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is the main <hi>Scope</hi> of the <hi>doctrinal</hi> part at leaſt, of this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How one thing <hi>hangs</hi> or <hi>depends</hi> upon another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which he alledgeth ſo often, <hi>make</hi> for the proofs, for which he alledgeth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How he <hi>uſeth</hi> many words, which he uſeth, and in <hi>what ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, that ſhort Epitome, which I have given of the <hi>eleven firſt</hi> Chapters, may ſuffice.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59465:6"/>
               <p>As for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> know <hi>first,</hi> that it is the manner of the Apoſtle, as in other of his Epiſtles, ſo <hi>eſpecially</hi> in this, to <hi>prevent objections,</hi> which may ariſe out of that which he ſaid either <hi>immediately,</hi> or a <hi>little before;</hi> which objections becauſe he doth not <hi>expreſs,</hi> but paſs them over in <hi>ſilence,</hi> and onely give the <hi>anſwer</hi> in <hi>expreſs</hi> terms, makes the greater <hi>Hiatus,</hi> and <hi>ſeeming independence</hi> of one ſentence upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be in his writings; which would not have been, if he had <hi>expreſſed</hi> the <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> as well as he doth the <hi>anſwers.</hi> And the <hi>variety</hi> of mens conjectures, what the <hi>objection,</hi> in every place from whence it ariſeth is, I conceive to be one <hi>great cauſe,</hi> that men ſo much <hi>differ</hi> in their judgements concerning the <hi>interpretation</hi> of divers places of this Epiſtle. But the <hi>objections,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> prevents, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, are not made <hi>alwaies</hi> in the perſon of <hi>one ſort</hi> of men, but <hi>ſometimes</hi> in the perſon of <hi>one,</hi> and ſometimes in the perſon of <hi>another;</hi> but moſt commonly his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are to be underſtood, as made in the perſon of <hi>a Jew:</hi> and yet not alwayes of <hi>one kind</hi> of Jew, but ſometimes of <hi>one,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>another;</hi> according to the <hi>diverſity</hi> of opinions, which were among the <hi>Jews.</hi> For <hi>ſome</hi> Jews thought it enough to their <hi>Juſtification,</hi> that they were the <hi>Children of Abraham; others,</hi> that they were <hi>circumciſed; others</hi> which were more <hi>learned,</hi> that they had <hi>excellent skill</hi> in the Law: And <hi>others</hi> who were <hi>highly</hi> conceited of the <hi>purity</hi> of their lives, <hi>relied</hi> upon their <hi>works</hi> for juſtification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Know <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That the Apoſtle, when he <hi>hath treated</hi> of a matter, and is <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> from that particular matter of which he treated, and is upon <hi>another</hi> ſubject, if in treating of this <hi>latter</hi> ſubject, any thing may ariſe to prove his <hi>former</hi> matter, he <hi>takes notice</hi> of it oftentimes, though it be <hi>but by the by,</hi> and though he hath <hi>no</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon ſo to do, but becauſe it <hi>proveth</hi> his <hi>former</hi> matter. An <hi>Example</hi> of this you may have <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. in thoſe words, <hi>So then Faith commeth by hearing,</hi> which was <hi>not</hi> the concluſion of the ſubject, which he <hi>had</hi> then in hand. For the ſubject, which he <hi>was</hi> then about, was to prove, <hi>that all the Jews believed not.</hi> For <hi>they</hi> (that is, the Jews) <hi>have not all obeyed the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. And <hi>this</hi> he proves there, <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. by the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> For (ſaith he) <hi>Eſaias ſaith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> Now <hi>out</hi> of this teſtimony of <hi>Eſaias,</hi> this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> may be as well drawn, <hi>Viz. That Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> as that <hi>Viz. That the Jews did not all believe.</hi> Wherefore <hi>becauſe this</hi> concluſion, <hi>Viz. Faith cometh by hearing</hi> may be drawn thence, as well as that <hi>other,</hi> he maketh mention of it here <hi>verſe</hi> 17. only to prove, that which he ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Viz. That none could believe in him of whom they have not heard.</hi> And after this manner (as I conceive) doth the Apoſtle <hi>bring</hi> in thoſe words of the <hi>Ninth Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the ſixteenth <hi>verſe, Viz. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Which <hi>concluſion</hi> he draws (and it <hi>evidently</hi> follows) out of thoſe foregoing words <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. Viz. <hi>For he ſaith unto Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy: And I will have compaſſion, on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> But yet this is not <hi>that</hi> for which he quoted thoſe words, but he quoted them to ſhew, <hi>that there was no unrighteouſneſs in God in ſhewing mercy to, or in juſtifying thoſe which were figured either</hi> in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or in <hi>Jacob;</hi> that is, in juſtifying the <hi>faithfull,</hi> though they were <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But yet becauſe he had <hi>bewailed</hi> the Jews, for that that they <hi>being ignorant of Gods Way of righteouſneſs or Juſtification, went about to eſtabliſh a way of their own, and had not ſubmitted themſelves to Gods way,</hi> and <hi>becauſe</hi> that from theſe words of the fifteenth <hi>verſe,</hi> an <hi>Argument</hi> might be drawn to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> them of their <hi>error,</hi> he <hi>draweth</hi> that Argument from thence, though by the by, and though it was <hi>not</hi> that concluſion or <hi>Theſis,</hi> which he was to prove in this place, when he was (as I ſaid) to prove here, <hi>that there was no unrighteouſneſs in God for ſhewing mercy to, or juſtifying thoſe which were typified either</hi> in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or in <hi>Jacob;</hi> that is, for <hi>juſtifying</hi> the <hi>faithfull,</hi> though they were <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing, which I ſaid was expedient to be known for the <hi>better</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was <hi>to know, how the parts of Scriptures which he alledgeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>herein ſo often, make for the purpoſes for which he alledgeth them:</hi> For indeed if any one ſhould <hi>turn</hi> to the <hi>ſeveral</hi> places, out of which he taketh his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture, <hi>it</hi> would ſeem <hi>ſtrange</hi> at the <hi>firſt,</hi> to ſee how <hi>Paul could</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59465:7"/> bring them, to prove ſuch things by them, as he <hi>bringeth</hi> them for.</p>
               <p>But that it may not ſeem <hi>strange,</hi> this muſt be <hi>obſerved,</hi> that <hi>many</hi> places of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament have a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe; <hi>One</hi> concerning <hi>terrene</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> things, and things to come to paſs <hi>before</hi> the dayes of the Meſſiah; <hi>Another</hi> concerning <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things, of which thoſe terrene and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal things were a Type. The <hi>firſt</hi> may be called the <hi>Literal,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>meaner</hi> ſenſe: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> the <hi>Myſtical</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe. Of which becauſe I have ſpoken fully in my <hi>Preface</hi> to my Expoſition upon the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak no more here: only this I add, that the Jews did acknowledge this <hi>twofold</hi> ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle, in his teſtimonies of Scripture, which he brings to prove <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi> matters, which he handles, takes thoſe <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of Scripture for the moſt part, <hi>not</hi> as they are in their <hi>firſt, literal, hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>meaner</hi> ſenſe; but as they are to be taken in their <hi>Myſticall</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, according to which, I have alſo interpreted them, in theſe my Commentaries reſpectively.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing which I ſaid was <hi>expedient</hi> to be known, for the <hi>better</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>to know, how</hi> he uſeth many words which he uſeth herein, and <hi>in what Senſe</hi> he uſeth them, and of as <hi>many</hi> of ſuch words, as I think convenient I ſhall now ſpeak in their <hi>Alphabetical</hi> order, adding <hi>ſome</hi> things alſo by occaſion of thoſe words, which will make to the <hi>further</hi> explication of <hi>ſome</hi> paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Epiſtle.

                  <p>It is true, that there is an <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>decree of Election,</hi> which God made before the foundation of the World, or <hi>from eternity.</hi> For <hi>he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. But yet there is <hi>an Election,</hi> which God doth make <hi>in time,</hi> yet <hi>in order to,</hi> or in <hi>execution</hi> of ſome eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe, or decree of his or other. For <hi>God</hi> doth nothing <hi>in time,</hi> but what he purpoſed to do from <hi>eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thus we read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 14.1. <hi>The Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet</hi> chooſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>Zechar.</hi> 1.17. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>My Cities through proſperity ſhall yet be ſpread abroad, and the Lord ſhall yet comfort Sion, and ſhall yet</hi> chooſe <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> And <hi>Zechar.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The Lord ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Judah his portion, and</hi> chooſe <hi>Jeruſalem again.</hi> All which words, being in the <hi>Future</hi> tenſe, ſhew that there is an <hi>Election,</hi> which God makes of things or perſons <hi>in time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come neerer to our <hi>preſent</hi> purpoſe. There is an <hi>Eelection of God,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:59465:8"/> followeth <hi>calling.</hi> For <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. And <hi>ye ſee your calling, Brethren,</hi> that is, ye ſee the event of your calling, <hi>how that not many wiſemen after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; But God hath</hi> choſen <hi>the weak things of the world, to confound the things, which are mighty, and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed hath he choſen; yea and things which are not, to bring to nought the things which are,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſes</hi> 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as <hi>the Election</hi> in thoſe places is <hi>an Election</hi> of God <hi>in time,</hi> ſo do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Election</hi> to be, of which we ſpeak of, to wit, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>this Election</hi> I take to be <hi>not immediately to eternal glory,</hi> or glorification, but <hi>to juſtification.</hi> For <hi>Election</hi> is a word, which ſignifies only <hi>the act</hi> of electing. But <hi>the Author</hi> of the Election, and <hi>the things,</hi> or perſon elected, and that <hi>to which</hi> they are elected, are to be gathered from the circumſtances of the place: And from the circumſtances of the place, I gather, that <hi>this Election</hi> is <hi>immediately not to glory,</hi> or glorification, but <hi>to juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For juſtification</hi> hath been in a manner the <hi>onely</hi> Subject of the <hi>doctrinal</hi> part of the Apoſtles diſcourſe hitherto; And of <hi>juſtification</hi> doth he ſpeak in <hi>this</hi> Chapter, and he <hi>concludes</hi> therewith, and therewith doth he <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>proſecute</hi> the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>the Election,</hi> which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of (<hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 9.11.) is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> to the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, <hi>to which</hi> that <hi>Election</hi> is, which he ſpoke of, in the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh</hi> Chapter of this Epiſtle, and the <hi>fifth</hi> verſe; I think no man doth ſo much as <hi>doubt:</hi> But that that <hi>Election</hi> cannot be underſtood of <hi>an Election immediately to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory,</hi> but of an <hi>Election immediately to juſtification,</hi> may be eaſily, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently gathered from that place and the context thereof; for <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> calling <hi>that Election</hi> an <hi>Election of grace,</hi> adds this <hi>verſe</hi> 6. And <hi>if by grace then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace: But if it be of works, then it is no more Grace, otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> Where he ſhews that <hi>that thing to which</hi> that Election is <hi>immediately,</hi> is ſo <hi>due</hi> to works, as that there is no <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>favour</hi> at all requiſite to his obteining of it, who hath <hi>works,</hi> that is, who hath <hi>ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> the Law, as that he <hi>never brake</hi> it in the <hi>leaſt</hi> particle or jot thereof, at <hi>any</hi> time. For <hi>to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. And <hi>if it be of works, then it is no more of Grace, otherwiſe work, were not work.</hi> Saith our Apoſtle thence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                  <p>But now (a man may ſay) cannot <hi>eternal glory</hi> be <hi>due</hi> as a reward to <hi>works?</hi> That is, cannot it be <hi>due</hi> to a man, if he hath <hi>kept</hi> the Law ſo <hi>exactly,</hi> as the Law requireth and ſo as that he <hi>never</hi> broke the Law at any time <hi>in the leaſt</hi> particle of it, as ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> would have done, if he had <hi>continued</hi> in his innocency?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>No,</hi> For though we ſhould ſuppoſe a <hi>man</hi> to have <hi>kept</hi> the Law ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly</hi> as the Law requires, and <hi>never</hi> to have broke it in the leaſt tittle thereof; yet would not <hi>eternal Glory</hi> be due to him for it, <hi>of debt:</hi> For there is <hi>no proportion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>his works</hi> and that <hi>glory,</hi> which ſhall be <hi>revealed in the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will ſay, that <hi>eternal glory</hi> would be <hi>due</hi> to ſuch a one <hi>for his works,</hi> by a <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> of works, which God made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, that <hi>God</hi> had made <hi>ſuch</hi> a covenant or a contract with <hi>Adam,</hi> yet would not <hi>eternal</hi> glory be due to the works of ſuch a man <hi>of debt,</hi> without the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God. For it would have been the <hi>meer grace and favour</hi> of God, to <hi>covenant</hi> or promiſe ſuch a reward to ſuch a man for <hi>his works;</hi> nor would <hi>that reward,</hi> which is due even to <hi>ſuch</hi> works upon this account be <hi>due</hi> to them of <hi>merit,</hi> (which is <hi>that which</hi> our Apoſtle means by <hi>debt, Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but onely by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that <hi>gratious promiſe or covenant</hi> by which God <hi>freely</hi> and graciouſly bound himſelf to <hi>reward</hi> the works of ſuch a man with <hi>eternal glory;</hi> ſo that in our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles language the <hi>reward</hi> would be ſtill of <hi>grace:</hi> For if the <hi>covenant</hi> or promiſe, which God made to <hi>Adam,</hi> of <hi>rewarding</hi> ſuch works with <hi>eternal glory,</hi> were <hi>enough</hi> to make the reward to be <hi>due</hi> to ſuch works <hi>of debt,</hi> and <hi>not of grace:</hi> Why ſhould not the <hi>New</hi> Covenant, or Promiſe, which God hath made to them <hi>which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> that he will <hi>reward</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> (if they <hi>continue</hi> in it to the End) with <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb facs="tcp:59465:9"/> glory,</hi> as Saint <hi>John</hi> 3.16, &amp;c. make the <hi>reward</hi> to be due to <hi>Faith,</hi> of <hi>debt,</hi> and <hi>not of grace,</hi> as well as that <hi>old</hi> Covenant would to <hi>works.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>The reward is therefore of Faith, that it might be by grace,</hi> Rom. 4.16.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Election</hi> therefore which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. cannot be an <hi>Election immediately to glory:</hi> And if the <hi>Election</hi> there ſpoken of, cannot be <hi>immediately to glory;</hi> then ſurely neither is the <hi>Election</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>an Election</hi> immediately to <hi>eternal glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But may <hi>juſtification</hi> be a <hi>reward</hi> due to <hi>works of debt?</hi> that is, ſuppoſe that a man did <hi>perfectly</hi> keep the Law, and as <hi>exactly</hi> as the Law requireth (as ſuppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> would have done, if he had <hi>continued</hi> in his innocency) would <hi>juſtification</hi> be due to him of <hi>debt,</hi> by reaſon of his works, and not of <hi>Grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, it <hi>would</hi> be due to him <hi>of debt,</hi> and <hi>not of grace.</hi> For (with reverence be it ſpoken) <hi>God</hi> would be <hi>unjuſt,</hi> if when ſuch <hi>a one,</hi> as had <hi>exactly</hi> kept the Law, and <hi>never</hi> broke it at any time in the leaſt tittle thereof, ſhould be accuſed as a <hi>ſinner,</hi> before him, he ſhould <hi>not</hi> juſtifie him, that is, if he ſhould <hi>not</hi> acquit him, and clear him of ſin, but ſhould condemn him for a ſinner. But <hi>that</hi> there <hi>ſhould be unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs with God, God forbid; for then how ſhould God judge the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus by what I have ſaid it may appear, that <hi>the Election</hi> which is ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. is <hi>immediately</hi> (not to <hi>eternal Glory,</hi> but) to <hi>justification,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the laſt place, as God may be ſaid to <hi>Elect</hi> or <hi>chooſe,</hi> and <hi>doth elect</hi> or <hi>chooſe</hi> men in <hi>time;</hi> and as he may be ſaid <hi>to elect</hi> or <hi>chooſe men in being,</hi> in time, <hi>to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and doth <hi>ſo</hi> elect them; So <hi>his Election</hi> of ſuch, is (as I conceive) by <hi>his actual,</hi> but <hi>free and gratious taking of them, by juſtifying them out of the number of thoſe, which are not juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For a man may be ſaid to <hi>make choice</hi> of a thing by ſome <hi>external,</hi> but <hi>free</hi> action of his towards or about the thing, which he is ſaid <hi>to chooſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when certain of thoſe which were bidden to a dinner, ſat down in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places, our Saviour is ſaid <hi>to have marked them, how they choſe out the chiefeſt rooms,</hi> Luke 14.7. They <hi>choſe</hi> therefore the higheſt or chiefeſt rooms, by their <hi>ſeating</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them. For to <hi>ſit down</hi> in the higheſt Rooms, and to <hi>chooſe</hi> the higheſt <hi>rooms,</hi> are there both one. And when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>when thou art bidden to a wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt room,</hi> Luke 14.8. It is, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>when thou art bidden to a wedding, chooſe not the higheſt room.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as <hi>a man</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>make choice</hi> of a thing, by ſome external, but free action of his towards or about the thing, which he is ſaid to chooſe, ſo may <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to come cloſſer to the buſineſs in hand, and to ſhew you how God chooſeth <hi>whom he</hi> chooſeth <hi>in time.</hi> It is ſaid to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 7. ver. 6, 7. <hi>Thou art an holy People unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath</hi> choſen <hi>thee to be a peculiar people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all the Nations, that are upon the face of the Earth. The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor</hi> chooſe <hi>you becauſe you were more in number than any people, for ye were the feweſt of all people, but becauſe the Lord loved you and becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworn unto your Fathers, hath the</hi> Lord brought you <hi>out with a mighty hand, and</hi> redeemed <hi>you out of the houſe of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh</hi> King of Aegypt. Here we ſee, <hi>how God choſe</hi> Iſrael, it was by <hi>bringing</hi> them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>redeeming</hi> them out of the houſe of bondage, by which he <hi>took</hi> them to be a <hi>peculiar people</hi> to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in all thoſe places aforementioned, which mention Gods <hi>chooſing</hi> in time, we may ſay, that God is ſaid actually to have <hi>choſen</hi> them, of whom he ſpeaks, when he did <hi>put them into that Eſtate,</hi> into which he ſaith, he would <hi>chooſe</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> may be taken, and is often taken for the <hi>actual chooſing</hi> of a thing, by a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> ſeparating of that thing from <hi>other</hi> things which are left, See <hi>Badoeus</hi> in his Commentaries, <hi>Page</hi> 645.</p>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle may ſeem to make choiſe of this word <hi>Election,</hi> for <hi>Juſtification</hi> in this place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. not only to ſhew <hi>Gods free act,</hi> about the <hi>believer, viz.</hi> that he ſo <hi>juſtified</hi> him, as that he might <hi>chooſe</hi> whether he would have juſtified him or no, becauſe he could not <hi>challenge</hi> it of <hi>debt:</hi> But alſo to ſhew, that whereas <hi>one</hi> Jew
<pb facs="tcp:59465:9"/> ſtood for juſtification, becauſe of his <hi>diſcent from Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe he ſought it <hi>by works:</hi> And <hi>the Believer</hi> ſought it <hi>by faith,</hi> God choſe <hi>the Believer</hi> though a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> him, whereas he paſſed by thoſe <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be asked therefore, who it is which God thus <hi>chooſeth</hi> or <hi>purpoſed</hi> thus to Elect to juſtification, I ſay, it is the <hi>Believer.</hi> For whatſoever Gods <hi>primary</hi> decree was; in the <hi>execution</hi> of that decree, and in the <hi>bringing</hi> of men to juſtification or ſalvation in <hi>time,</hi> he juſtifies none, but ſuch as do firſt <hi>truely believe,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> ſuch he juſtifieth; and he <hi>ſaveth</hi> none, but ſuch as do <hi>truely believe,</hi> and <hi>perſevere</hi> therein to the end, and <hi>all</hi> ſuch he <hi>will ſave;</hi> and ſo to do <hi>in time,</hi> and to obſerve that order, <hi>he purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to do from eternity, notwitſtſtanding any <hi>Antecedent purpoſe</hi> or decree of his, going any way before.</p>
                  <p>But yet our Apoſtle attributes our juſtification wholly to <hi>God, who calleth, Rom.</hi> 9.11. And this he doth, to ſignifie that it is <hi>wholly of God,</hi> to preſcribe <hi>the way</hi> to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (who hath preſcribed faith to be the way thereunto, <hi>that</hi> juſtification may be known to be of his <hi>meer grace,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi>) and that it is <hi>not in man</hi> to preſcribe the way, though man makes an account to obtain juſtification by <hi>works,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>who went about to eſtabliſh their own way to juſtification,</hi> Rom. 10.3. and <hi>ſaught it by works,</hi> Rom. 9.32. which if they could obtain by <hi>works,</hi> the <hi>Way</hi> of juſtification would be <hi>in man</hi> indeed, and juſtification would be not of <hi>grace,</hi> but of <hi>debt.</hi> Again he may aſcribe it wholly to <hi>God;</hi> becauſe God is the <hi>principle</hi> cauſe thereof. For it is uſual, when <hi>two</hi> cauſes concur to the <hi>ſame</hi> effect, to aſcribe the <hi>effect wholly to the principal</hi> cauſe, yea, and ſo to aſcribe it to the <hi>principal</hi> cauſe, as to <hi>deny</hi> it to the cauſe <hi>leſs</hi> principal. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I labored more then they all; yet not I but the grace of God which is in me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And again. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me,</hi> Rom. 7.17. After this manner, I ſay that <hi>juſtification</hi> may be aſcribed <hi>wholly</hi> to God, <hi>Who calleth,</hi> though <hi>Faith</hi> be required thereunto.</p>

For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> And it is written, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Chriſt, in whom ye truſted alſo, after ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpell of your ſalvation in whom alſo after ye believed</hi> (the ſaid Goſpel) <hi>ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe.</hi> And <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Striving together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> therefore, or that eſſential part thereof, to wit, the <hi>new covenant</hi> of God with man is the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> or <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſo, I may ſay, that <hi>ſaving</hi> or <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith, is <hi>a full or firm aſſent of our heart or mind, to the Goſpel of God, or at leaſt to the new Covenant, which God was pleaſed to make with ſinful man, in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, therein conteined, by reaſon of which we do infallibly ſet our ſelves one work, one that part of the Covenant, which we are to performe, according to the ability, which God hath given us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>new Covenant</hi> made by God with man in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> conſiſteth (as <hi>other</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants do) of <hi>two</hi> parts, <hi>One</hi> part which <hi>God</hi> promiſeth, and covenanteth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on <hi>his</hi> part to perform: <hi>The other,</hi> which God <hi>requireth</hi> us to do, and which we <hi>muſt</hi> promiſe and covenant to performe on <hi>our</hi> part; <hi>without</hi> the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on our part. God is <hi>not</hi> bound to make good to us, what <hi>he</hi> covenanted and promiſed to do for us, <hi>one his</hi> part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eye</hi> therefore of our <hi>Faith,</hi> muſt be firmely fixed on <hi>both</hi> parts of this covenant, as well on <hi>that</hi> part, which <hi>we our ſelves</hi> are for <hi>our</hi> part to performe, as on <hi>that</hi> which God is to performe on <hi>his</hi> part, or <hi>elſe</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> will <hi>never</hi> avail us to <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if we look on <hi>that</hi> part of the Covenant, which God hath promiſed for <hi>his</hi> part to perform and <hi>firmly</hi> believe the <hi>truth</hi> thereof, and that <hi>our onely happineſs</hi> conſiſteth therein: And on <hi>that</hi> part of the Covenant, which we for <hi>our parts</hi> are to performe, and <hi>firmly</hi> believe that by doing <hi>our</hi> parts, we ſhall attain to <hi>that</hi> happineſs, which God for <hi>his</hi> part promiſed to beſtow upon us, and that, <hi>only</hi> by doing ſo, we ſhall attain to it: <hi>Surely</hi> we ſhall be <hi>juſtified.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> will <hi>prove</hi> an <hi>operative</hi> Faith and <hi>ſet us</hi> on work, according to <hi>our</hi> power, to obtein <hi>our</hi> only happineſs, and make us <hi>ſedulous</hi> in the duties of <hi>holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee</hi> God, Hebrews 12.14.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>every</hi> one doth <hi>naturally</hi> deſire his <hi>own happineſs;</hi> and every one <hi>labours</hi> for his own bleſſedneſs: and that <hi>ſo</hi> many <hi>miſs</hi> of happineſs, and <hi>come ſhort</hi> of bleſſedneſs, it is <hi>not</hi> becauſe they <hi>deſire not</hi> to be happy, or labour <hi>not</hi> for it: <hi>but</hi> becauſe they are <hi>ignorant</hi> in what true happineſs, or true bleſſedneſs doth <hi>conſiſt;</hi> and embrace a <hi>cloud</hi> for <hi>Juno,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow</hi> for the <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For (as the<note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtot.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we did <hi>truely believe,</hi> that our <hi>chiefeſt</hi> happineſs, and our <hi>ſummum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> did conſiſt in <hi>that Glory,</hi> and immortality, which <hi>God hath</hi> promiſed and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to give us; and <hi>that we</hi> ſhould attein to it, if we <hi>walk</hi> in that way, which he hath preſcribed to <hi>lead</hi> us to it, ſurely we <hi>ſhould</hi> walke in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Saviour</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Kingdome of heaven is like to a treaſure hid in a field, which when a man had found it, he hideth it, and for joy thereof, goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field,</hi> to wit that he might be the <hi>Lord</hi> and poſſeſſor of that <hi>treaſure,</hi> which went a long with the poſſeſſion of that field, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44.

<pb facs="tcp:59465:10"/> who when he had found one pearl of good price, he went and ſold all that he had and bought it, Mat.</hi> 13.45, 46.

                     <hi>determine</hi> ſo to <hi>love</hi> them and doth <hi>ſo love</hi> them, as that he will <hi>not leave them utterly</hi> without all <hi>means</hi> of ſalvation.

                  <p>Thoſe two former parcels of Scripture, <hi>viz</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.44. carry a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe with them, to wit, an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and a <hi>Myſtical,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> of them concern the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> ſenſe, concerns their <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>bodily</hi> eſtate, of which I ſpeak <hi>not</hi> now. The <hi>Miſtical</hi> concerns their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> eſtate, and in relation to that, the <hi>promiſe</hi> is, that God would <hi>not leave them all utterly</hi> without the <hi>means</hi> of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A <hi>promiſe</hi> which God <hi>never</hi> made to any nation but <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How <hi>much</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>offended at Chriſt,</hi> and how they did, <hi>not only</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, but where <hi>contentious</hi> againſt it, we <hi>read</hi> and <hi>know.</hi> Yet for all that did <hi>not</hi> God <hi>leave</hi> them without the <hi>means</hi> of Salvation; For the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of God, did preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among them, while they were yet in their land; And though <hi>the Jews</hi> be now <hi>diſperſed</hi> up and down throughout the <hi>world,</hi> yet are they <hi>not now</hi> utterly without <hi>ſuch</hi> means.</p>
                  <p>For they <hi>alwayes had</hi> and <hi>have</hi> the <hi>Scriptures of the old Teſtament,</hi> thoſe <hi>Oracles of God which God committed to them,</hi> and which <hi>testifie</hi> of Chriſt, and which would be <hi>manifeſt</hi> unto them. For <hi>the obedience of the Faith,</hi> by the things which <hi>have been acted</hi> in the world, and the events, which <hi>have</hi> happened, if they would <hi>obſerve</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>moreover,</hi> though their <hi>diſperſion,</hi> through the world, was laid upon them, as <hi>a curſe</hi> for their ſins, and <hi>eſpecially</hi> for their <hi>enmity</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Goſple;</hi> yet as <hi>that curſe</hi> which <hi>Jacob</hi> denounced againſt <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I will divide them in Jacob and ſcatter them in Iſrael,</hi> Gen. 49.7. was turned into a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> ſo may we ſay, that <hi>the diſperſion</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> hath a <hi>bleſſing</hi> in it to, in that by <hi>this,</hi> a very <hi>great part</hi> of them <hi>had</hi> and <hi>have</hi> their <hi>converſation</hi> among, or <hi>commerce</hi> with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by whom they might and may <hi>come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who can <hi>tell</hi> but that it may be by <hi>theſe</hi> means even <hi>at this day,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid it was in <hi>his time</hi> (though it cannot demonſtratively be <hi>pointed</hi> at) that <hi>there is a remnant acording to the Election of grace, Rom.</hi> 7.4. that is, that there <hi>is a Remnunt of Jews even at this time which is juſtified through faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But moreover our Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>When the fulneſs of the Gentiles are come in, God will ſend a deliverer, and he ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Rom. 11.26. Which <hi>Deliverer</hi> is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who ſhall <hi>by</hi> ſuch ſervants as he ſhall make choice of, and by <hi>ſuch</hi> means as he ſhall think fit, (and he ſees that they will for a great, or the greateſt part of them, embrace;) bring them <hi>ſweetly</hi> without any irreſiſtable force <hi>to believe.</hi> And though he hath in the mean time concluded <hi>The greateſt</hi> part of them in <hi>unbelief,</hi> yet it is for this <hi>end,</hi> that <hi>He might have mercy upon them</hi> (though we <hi>cannot</hi> perceive by the light of <hi>our</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>how</hi> God produceth ſuch an effect, by means ſeeming ſo <hi>repugnant</hi> to the end) Rom. 11.32.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But to this I anſwer, that <hi>Verbs active,</hi> do not alwayes ſignifie <hi>the doing</hi> of that which they do <hi>import.</hi> For God ſaith unto <hi>Jeremy, See, I have this day ſet thee over the Nations and over the Kingdoms, and to root out, and to pull down, to deſtroy, and to throw down, and to build, and to plant, Jerem.</hi> 1.10. whereas God <hi>ſet</hi> him <hi>only to propheſie</hi> of the <hi>rooting</hi> out, and of the <hi>pulling</hi> down, and the <hi>deſtroying,</hi> and <hi>throwing</hi> down of <hi>ſome</hi> Nations, or <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and the <hi>building</hi> up, or <hi>planting</hi> of others.</p>
                  <p>And God ſaith, that if the <hi>Prophet be deceived, I the Lord have deceived him, Ezech.</hi> 14.9. whereas the Lord <hi>did not uſe</hi> any deceit to that <hi>Prophet,</hi> but did <hi>only ſuffer</hi> him, either to <hi>deceive himſelf,</hi> by the illuſions of his own phantaſie, or the <hi>Devil</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi> him, by being <hi>a falſe Spirit</hi> in his mouth. For, as God <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>deceived,</hi> ſo he <hi>cannot deceive;</hi> and as he cannot be <hi>tempted,</hi> ſo he cannot <hi>tempt,</hi> Jam. 1.13.</p>
                  <p>So God is ſaid to have <hi>afflicted</hi> or <hi>evil intreated</hi> his people; whenas it was <hi>Pharaoh indeed</hi> which did <hi>poſitively afflict</hi> them, or <hi>evilly intreat</hi> them (being <hi>offended</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> at that meſſage which God ſent to him by <hi>Moſes</hi>) not <hi>God:</hi> yet <hi>Moſes</hi> when he ſaw <hi>that</hi> Pharaoh <hi>did evilly intreat the people</hi> of Iſrael, upon his meſſage <hi>to</hi> Pharaoh <hi>to let them go,</hi> he returned unto the Lord and ſaid, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou ſo evilly intreated this people?</hi> Exod. 5.22.</p>
                  <p>So, according to that old Proverb, <hi>Blanda Patrum ſegnes facit indulgentia Natos,</hi> The <hi>fond indulgency</hi> of Fathers is ſaid to <hi>make</hi> the Children naught, when they do only <hi>connive</hi> at them, but inſtill no naught into them; And <hi>qui non vetat, cùm poſſit, peccare jubet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi> Troas.

He which <hi>forbids not</hi> or <hi>hindreth not</hi> a man, that he <hi>ſins not</hi> (but <hi>permits</hi> him to ſin) when he might <hi>hinder</hi> him, <hi>commands</hi> him or <hi>makes</hi> him to ſin. And <hi>thus</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>harden</hi> Pharaohs <hi>heart,</hi> or to <hi>ſtir him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people,</hi> only becauſe he <hi>permitted Pharaoh</hi> upon <hi>thoſe</hi> occaſions, which <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> took, <hi>to harden his heart,</hi> and to <hi>exalt himſelf</hi> againſt his people, when he might have <hi>hindred</hi> him <hi>from</hi> ſo doing, and might have <hi>mollified</hi> him by his diſpenſations, as he <hi>had done others,</hi> if he <hi>would.</hi>

                  <p>But when God doth <hi>not hinder</hi> men from <hi>ſo</hi> doing, but permits them <hi>ſo</hi> to do, and <hi>mollifies them not,</hi> he doth it, as a <hi>Judge,</hi> to <hi>puniſh</hi> ſome <hi>former</hi> evil thereby, which they had done. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> indeed had <hi>done evil, in keeping the people of Iſrael in ſuch bondage</hi> as he had, and by <hi>ſo oppreſſing</hi> them as he did (for they were <hi>not</hi> a people which were <hi>ſubdued,</hi> or brought into bondage, either to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or to the Egyptians by any <hi>juſt</hi> War; but were a people whom they had <hi>received</hi> into their <hi>protection,</hi> or <hi>tutelage,</hi> for <hi>Joſephs good deſerts at their hands</hi>) which <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> nevertheleſs God, <hi>no doubt,</hi> would have <hi>paſſed by,</hi> if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at Gods command had <hi>freely</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:59465:13"/> 
                     <hi>willingly</hi> let the people go. Gods <hi>primary</hi> intent therefore of <hi>ſending to Pharaoh,</hi> was, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might <hi>let the people go,</hi> that ſo he might do <hi>him good,</hi> as he did <hi>Cyrus good</hi> in after-times, for <hi>delivering</hi> his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity, Iſaiah</hi> 45. But becauſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would <hi>not let his people go</hi> (as he foreſaw and foretold <hi>Moſes) Exod.</hi> 3.19. but would <hi>harden his heart,</hi> and ſtir up himſelf <hi>the more</hi> againſt them, he <hi>ſuffered</hi> him <hi>ſo</hi> to do, becauſe he <hi>knew</hi> how to bring <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil;</hi> and to make his <hi>power known by the wonderful Plagues,</hi> which he would bring upon him, if he <hi>let not his people go;</hi> and how to get himſelf great <hi>glory</hi> in his <hi>deſtruction</hi> in the Red Sea, if he <hi>perſiſted</hi> in his obſtinacy; in which he <hi>perſiſting,</hi> God brought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <hi>plagues</hi> upon him, and at length <hi>overwhelmed</hi> him and all his huge Army in the Red Sea, while they <hi>purſued</hi> the Iſraelites there.</p>
                  <p>Thus did God (in manner as I have ſaid) <hi>juſtly harden Pharaohs</hi> heart, and if he <hi>hardened</hi> Pharaoh <hi>justly,</hi> he may (as the Apoſtle <hi>concludes</hi> from hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 18.) <hi>juſtly harden whom he will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if he can <hi>juſtly harden whom he will,</hi> he may <hi>much</hi> more <hi>deny</hi> remiſſion of ſins and juſtification <hi>to whom he will;</hi> and, by conſequence, he <hi>may</hi> juſtly deny remiſſion of Sins and juſtification, to thoſe that <hi>obey not,</hi> or <hi>believe not</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>whatſoever</hi> they are, whether Jews or Gentiles; and <hi>juſtly</hi> harden them too, if they continue <hi>obſtinate</hi> in their unbelief, and are <hi>contentious</hi> againſt the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>malepart</hi> Jew, when he hears Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>that whom God will he hardeneth</hi> Rom. 9.18. <hi>ſtarts</hi> up here and ſayes, <hi>why</hi> then doth God <hi>find fault</hi> with us Jews for the hardneſs of our hearts, for if <hi>he will</hi> harden our hearts we <hi>cannot</hi> help it; for <hi>who hath reſisted his will?</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>takes up</hi> for this his ſaucineſs in chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Logick with God, in the nineteenth and twentieth verſes, and then in the 21. and 22. verſes gives him a <hi>more direct</hi> anſwer to his objection, in thoſe words, <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, hath endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which words may be gathered from <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 8. as I conceive.</p>
                  <p>I conceive therefore the <hi>ſenſe</hi> thereof to be this, <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known</hi> in their deſtruction, if they would not repent, <hi>hath endured the Veſſels of Wrath</hi> (thoſe I mean, which are contentious, and obey not the truth, but <hi>obey</hi> unrighteouſneſs) <hi>with much long-ſuffering,</hi> (which leadeth in it ſelf to repentance:) But they (<hi>abuſing</hi> that long-ſuffering of God,) and <hi>hardning</hi> their hearts, and becoming impenitent, by occaſion of that:) by their <hi>hardneſs,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent hearts, treaſure up unto themſelves <hi>wrath</hi> againſt the day of wrath, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the righteous judgement of God, and <hi>ſo</hi> are <hi>fitted</hi> by themſelves <hi>to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> What I ſay, <hi>if</hi> God be <hi>angry</hi> or find <hi>fault</hi> with them for <hi>this?</hi> or what <hi>if</hi> God be ſaid to <hi>harden</hi> them, becauſe they took occaſion from this his long-ſuffering, to <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> their own hearts? What <hi>canſt</hi> thou ſay to this? or what <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> is there in God for this? And what <hi>if</hi> moreover he did this (as it follows verſe 23.) for this end, <hi>viz. that he might make known the Riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of mercy, which he had before prepared to Glory;</hi> What canſt thou ſay to it, or what unrighteouſneſs is there in God, for it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note</hi> therefore <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Apoſtle doth here <hi>give</hi> in this, 22. verſe, a more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> anſwer, then he did in the two foregoing verſes, to that ſaucy queſtion (which a malepart Jew made, when he heard Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay of God, that <hi>whom he will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth</hi>) viz. <hi>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> In which anſwer, he ſhews, that God might <hi>juſtly</hi> find fault and be <hi>angry</hi> with, the hardned Jews; And that God is not ſaid to <hi>harden</hi> them, becauſe he <hi>poſitively</hi> wrought hardneſs in them, but becauſe <hi>they</hi> themſelves <hi>hardened</hi> their hearts, and he <hi>ſuffered</hi> them to harden them, by his <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>Note <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe <hi>hardneſs</hi> God is ſaid to <hi>complain</hi> of, Ver. 19. were <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>ſought</hi> juſtification otherwiſe, than <hi>by faith,</hi> and would <hi>not</hi> believe the Goſpel when it was <hi>preached</hi> to them; but were <hi>contentious</hi> againſt it. For the <hi>Jews</hi> for the <hi>moſt</hi> part when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was preached unto them, did <hi>not</hi> onely <hi>not</hi> believe it, but were <hi>contentious</hi> againſt it, as will appear by the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>

                  <p>This account I have given of what I <hi>conceived</hi> concerning <hi>the hardning of Pharaohs heart,</hi> and of thoſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up,</hi> &amp;c. In my Commentaries.</p>
                  <p>But having ſince the printing of them read, and <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> conſidered the Annotations of that <hi>learned, induſtrious, judicious,</hi> and <hi>acute</hi> Doctor, Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> upon <hi>Rom</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. (who hath given much <hi>light</hi> to many <hi>dark</hi> places of Scripture.) And having the <hi>opportunity</hi> to do it by reaſon of the <hi>ſtanding</hi> of the preſs ſince the printing of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe and Commentaries by reaſon of theſe late ſad times, I would not hide, that <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> light, which that Reverend Doctor hath given to <hi>this</hi> place, but hold it out here.</p>
                  <p>He therefore having judiciouſly <hi>weighed</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> ſtory of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in his book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the <hi>ſeverall paſſages</hi> thereof, obſerveth, that when God was <hi>ſending Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh to let his people go,</hi> God <hi>foretold Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Paraoh</hi> would <hi>harden</hi> his heart, when he <hi>ſent</hi> to him, in <hi>thoſe</hi> words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.19. <hi>I am ſure that the King of Aegypt will not let you go, no not by a mighty hand.</hi> And he <hi>foretold</hi> him alſo, that he <hi>the Lord</hi> would <hi>harden Pharaohs</hi> heart, in thoſe words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Do all thy wonders before Pharaoh which I have put into thy hand, but I will harden his heart, that he ſhall not let the people go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though God did <hi>early</hi> foretell, that he would <hi>harden</hi> Pharoahs heart, yet (as he obſerveth) God did <hi>not</hi> do it <hi>immediately.</hi> For at the <hi>ſix firſt plagues</hi> or judgements, which God ſent upon him, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>hardened his own heart;</hi> and God is <hi>not</hi> ſaid to have <hi>hardned</hi> Pharaohs heart untill the <hi>ſeveneth.</hi> So that <hi>Pharaoh hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his own heart ſix</hi> times, before that God is ſaid to <hi>have hardened it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from this obſervation of the <hi>time</hi> when God is ſaid to have <hi>hardned Pharaohs heart</hi> (which was not <hi>till after</hi> Pharaoh <hi>had hardned his own heart ſix times,</hi> againſt Gods ſigns and judgements) He gathereth, that <hi>Gods hardning Pharaohs heart,</hi> was the <hi>total</hi> withdrawing of his grace of Repentence from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> manner as when one is caſt into <hi>Hell,</hi> which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at <hi>that</hi> time had been, <hi>had</hi> it not been <hi>more</hi> for Gods glory to <hi>continue</hi> him <hi>alive</hi> a while, in that <hi>deſperate irreverſible</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which ſure was no <hi>whit worſe</hi> to him, but <hi>ſomewhat better,</hi> and more deſirable, then to have been <hi>adjudged</hi> to thoſe flames at that time.</p>
                  <p>When therefore <hi>God</hi> had <hi>thus hardned Pharaohs heart.</hi> He ſaid (by <hi>Moſes</hi>) unto <hi>Pharaoh. And now at this time</hi> (or turn) <hi>will I pour out all my plagues upon thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And now I had ſtretched out my hand, and had ſmitten thee and thy people with the peſtilence, and thou hadſt been cut off, from the earth: But in very deed for this cauſe have I made thee ſtand</hi> (or kept thee alive) <hi>to ſhew or make to be ſeen my power in thee,</hi> Exod. 9. ver. 16, 17. For thus doth he accutely interpret theſe words.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>read</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Annotations, in which are <hi>many</hi> things of this kind, <hi>worthy</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p>Thus as he obſerveth did God <hi>harden Pharaohs heart,</hi> and this was (as he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>a notable</hi> and withall (as far as we find in Scripture) <hi>a ſingular</hi> example of Gods dealing with an <hi>impoenitent,</hi> that had <hi>filled</hi> up his meaſure, keeping him <hi>alive</hi> but <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> any Grace, and conſequent <hi>poſſibility</hi> of amending.</p>
                  <p>And now, ſay I, from Gods <hi>thus</hi> dealing with <hi>Phaaraoh</hi> we may <hi>conclude,</hi> that God <hi>can deny mercy to whom he will,</hi> and ſo by conſequence <hi>deny remiſſion of ſins,</hi> or <hi>juſtification to thoſe who will not believe the Goſpel,</hi> yea and <hi>harden</hi> them too in the <hi>higheſt</hi> degree, <hi>if</hi> they are <hi>obſtinately</hi> contentious againſt it.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:59465:14"/>
                  <p>But <hi>if</hi> that paſſage of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taken out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. be to be read thus, Even for this ſame purpoſe <hi>have I kept thee alive,</hi> that I might ſhew my power in thee, &amp;c. It may be asked, how <hi>that</hi> concluſion which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth there, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. viz. <hi>Whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> can be deduced from thence.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That that concluſion, <hi>Whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> may be deduced from thoſe words, <hi>For this ſame purpoſe have I kept thee alive, that I might ſhew my power in thee,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe words, <hi>For this ſame purpoſe have I kept thee alive,</hi> muſt be conſidered <hi>in relation</hi> to the <hi>ſtory</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as it is recorded in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> they will <hi>imply an hardning.</hi> For they will <hi>imply Gods hardning Pharaohs</hi> heart. For it was upon <hi>Gods hardning Pharaohs</hi> heart, that God kept <hi>Pharaoh alive,</hi> that he might <hi>ſhew</hi> his power in him. And then that concluſion, <hi>Whom he will he hardneth,</hi> is deducible from it.</p>
                  <p>Another queſtion may be asked here. <hi>How that hardning,</hi> whereby God hardned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, can be <hi>underſtood</hi> of Gods <hi>total</hi> withholding of his Grace of Repentance from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whereas <hi>Pharaoh afterwards repented,</hi> and <hi>let the people go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>let the people go,</hi> yet did he not <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>heartily</hi> repent, as appears by that, that <hi>ſoon after</hi> he had let the people go, he <hi>purſued</hi> after them to <hi>bring them back</hi> again into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whereby he was <hi>drowned</hi> in the Red Sea.</p>

                  <p>Now we read of this word <hi>Holy,</hi> Rom. 11.16. where it is ſaid, <hi>If the root be holy ſo are the branches;</hi> In which place the Apoſtle compares <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Jews, to the <hi>root of an Olive-tree,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> which ſprang out of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>carnal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,</hi> to the <hi>branches of that Tree.</hi> And ſaith of <hi>both</hi> of them, that they were <hi>holy.</hi>

                  <p>But why doth he ſay of <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>he was holy,</hi> and of the Jews that they were <hi>holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he was <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe God <hi>called</hi> him from his <hi>own</hi> kindred and from his <hi>Fathers</hi> houſe (who were <hi>Idolaters</hi>) and <hi>ſeparated</hi> him from <hi>them,</hi> to be a <hi>worſhipper</hi> of him, and to <hi>ſerve</hi> him, and promiſed him above all the world beſides, that he would be <hi>a God unto him.</hi> And he ſaith of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> were <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe God <hi>choſe</hi> them, and <hi>exalted</hi> them to be a <hi>peculiar</hi> people and <hi>Church</hi> unto himſelf, to <hi>worſhip</hi> him and <hi>ſerve</hi> him, as he ſhould appoint; and <hi>promiſed</hi> them that he would <hi>never</hi> leave them or <hi>forſake</hi> them <hi>utterly,</hi> ſo as that they ſhould be at any time <hi>utterly</hi> without the means of Salvation; which was a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> and a <hi>bleſſing</hi> which God never made to <hi>any other</hi> people then to <hi>them,</hi> and ſo by that <hi>ſeparated</hi> and <hi>diſcriminated</hi> them from all other <hi>people</hi> elſe.</p>
                  <p>But now, how doth this <hi>follow,</hi> or wherein doth the validity of that conſequence

                  <p>
                     <hi>To juſtifie,</hi> as it is moſt frequently uſed in this Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is a Law term, uſed and borrowed from <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> wherein he is ſaid <hi>to be juſtified,</hi> who is <hi>abſolved,</hi> or freed, or acquited, or cleared from ſome capitall crime whereof he was <hi>accuſed</hi> by the <hi>Sentence</hi> pronounced by the Judge; and being acquited or abſolved from the <hi>Crime,</hi> is alſo abſolved or acquited from the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which the Accuſers asked againſt him, as <hi>due</hi> to the <hi>crime</hi> whereof they accuſed him, and is dealt with, as with an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>Hence to <hi>be juſtified,</hi> and to be <hi>condemned</hi> are <hi>oppoſed</hi> as contraries one to another, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.37. <hi>By thy works thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy works thou ſhalt be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To be juſtified</hi> therefore is for <hi>a man to be abſolved or acquited by the Judge from thoſe crimes and accuſations, which are laid to his charge by his accuſers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now he that <hi>is accuſed</hi> may be, either an <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> man; or he may be a <hi>Delinquent</hi> or <hi>Offender.</hi> And either of theſe may be <hi>juſtified,</hi> that is, may be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited</hi> of the <hi>crimes</hi> laid to his charge, and the <hi>puniſhmont</hi> due to thoſe crimes, by this <hi>Judge. The</hi> former, that is to ſay, the <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> man, by reaſon of his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi> or by reaſon of that, that <hi>he was not found guilty</hi> of the crimes whereof he was accuſed. The other, to wit, the <hi>Delinquent</hi> or <hi>Offender,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of the Judge to him, who notwithſtanding that that he was <hi>guilty</hi> of the crimes laid to his charge, did <hi>acquit</hi> him of the Action or Accuſations put in againſt him, and <hi>abſolve</hi> him from it, and give him a <hi>free pardon</hi> of thoſe his offences.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>firſt, to be juſtified,</hi> or <hi>to be cleared,</hi> or abſolved, from the accuſation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was accuſed, did appertain of <hi>due,</hi> or of <hi>right,</hi> or of <hi>juſtice:</hi> For the <hi>Judge</hi> would have been <hi>unjuſt,</hi> if he had not acquited him: But to the <hi>Second, to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> or <hi>to be cleared,</hi> or abſolved from the accuſation, wherewith he was accuſed, was meerly an <hi>Act of grace</hi> and favour, in that the <hi>judge</hi> did out of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> acquit him, or abſolve, or clear, him from the action or crime laid unto his charge, and the puniſhment thereunto due, and did <hi>pardon</hi> his offences, whereas he might juſtly have <hi>condemned</hi> him for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now according</hi> to this, or in alluſion to this, which I have ſaid, <hi>He that</hi> doth the works of the Law ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>exactly</hi> as the Law requireth, is ſaid by our Apoſtle <hi>to be juſtified by his works,</hi> for <hi>the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified</hi> ſaith he <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. That is, they ſhall be juſtified by <hi>their doing</hi> the Law. And they which are ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are ſaid to be juſtified <hi>of debt.</hi> For <hi>to him that worketh is the reward</hi> (which is <hi>Juſtification) not reckoned of grace but of debt,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>If it</hi> (to wit, juſtification) <hi>be of works, then it is not of grace, otherwiſe work is no more work,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. And indeed if Satan ſhould <hi>accuſe</hi> ſuch a one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and require that he might be caſt into the ſame condemnation with
<pb facs="tcp:59465:15"/> himſelf, <hi>God</hi> would (with reverence be it ſpoken) be <hi>unjuſt,</hi> if he ſhould not acquit him, and clear him of that for which Satan accuſed him; and this <hi>juſtification</hi> may be called <hi>the juſtification of an innocent</hi> or <hi>righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, according to that which I ſaid, Is <hi>he which believeth</hi> juſtified. <hi>For a man</hi> (which Believeth) is <hi>juſtified by his faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. But this <hi>juſtification</hi> is not of <hi>debt,</hi> but of <hi>Grace.</hi> For <hi>therefore it is of faith, that it may be by grace,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. I ſay ſuch a man which <hi>believeth,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>juſtified,</hi> becauſe though Satan ſhould accuſe him before God the Judge of all, as ſuch a one, who hath <hi>broken</hi> the Law, and ſhould <hi>require</hi> of him, that he ſhould be <hi>damned</hi> for it, yet would God <hi>abſolve</hi> him and give him a <hi>free pardon</hi> of all his ſins, and deal with him, as with an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> man, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his ſake, in whom he <hi>believeth.</hi> And this may be called <hi>the juſtification of a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The juſtification of the former man</hi> is reckoned to him for his <hi>works ſake: The juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of this <hi>latter</hi> is imputed to him through the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>mercy of God</hi> in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> and conſiſteth <hi>in the free pardon and remiſſion of his ſins,</hi> according to that which is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered, bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, that the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of an <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> man, and the <hi>Juſtification of a Sinner</hi> which <hi>believeth,</hi> agree <hi>both</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> that they are <hi>both abſolved,</hi> and acquited from the accuſation laid againſt them by Satan, but <hi>they differ</hi> in this, that <hi>one</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited for his <hi>workes</hi> ſake, the <hi>other</hi> is acquited through the <hi>meer grace</hi> and <hi>mercy of God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that though I have ſhewed how a <hi>righteous man,</hi> which hath exactly kept the Law <hi>is juſtified,</hi> I do not thereby <hi>affirm,</hi> or hold, that there <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>hath been,</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>will be</hi> any ſuch man (<hi>For by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. For if <hi>Righteouſneſs come by the Law,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> Galat. 2 12. <hi>And all the world is become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19.) but I ſay <hi>onely,</hi> that if we ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> that there were any <hi>righteous</hi> man, which had exactly kept the Law, he would be <hi>juſtified</hi> after that <hi>manner,</hi> which I have ſpoken of. <hi>So</hi> when our Apoſtle <hi>ſaid</hi> that <hi>the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified,</hi> Rom. 2.13. He did <hi>not</hi> ſay that there <hi>were</hi> any ſuch doers of the Law, as had <hi>ſo</hi> done the works of the Law, as the Law in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour exacts, but he did <hi>only</hi> ſhew what they <hi>muſt</hi> do, who would <hi>be juſtified by the Law,</hi> they muſt not be onely <hi>hearers</hi> of the Law, but <hi>doers</hi> alſo of the Law. And when he ſaid now <hi>to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. He ſaid not that there was any which did <hi>work,</hi> or had <hi>wrought,</hi> that is, he ſaid not that any one did <hi>work,</hi> or had <hi>wrought</hi> the work of the Law, ſo <hi>exactly</hi> as the Law requireth, which required a <hi>perfect</hi> obſervation thereof of a man throughout the <hi>whole</hi> courſe of his life; but this he ſaid that if we ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that there were any ſuch man, then the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> would not be reckoned to him of <hi>grace,</hi> but of <hi>debt.</hi> And after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is he to be <hi>underſtood,</hi> when he ſaith. <hi>If it be of works then it is no more of grace, otherwiſe work is no more work,</hi> Rom 11.6.</p>

                  <p>Our <hi>Apostle</hi> doth often make mention of <hi>Works</hi> in this his Epiſtle, while he treats of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded, by what Law? of works: Nay,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works, he had whereof to glory,</hi> and verſe 4. <hi>Now to him that worketh, (i. e.</hi> to him which hath <hi>works) is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt,</hi> and verſe 6. <hi>Even</hi> as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the <hi>bleſſedneſs of the man, to whom God imputeth righteouſneſs, without works;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If it be of works, then it is no more of grace;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>We conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds or works of the Law.</hi> In <hi>all</hi> which places, and the like, he takes <hi>works</hi> for <hi>works exactly done according to the Law, ſo that the doer of them did never, through the whole courſe of his life, break the Law, either in thought, word or deed; either by commiſſion or by omiſſion, or by any other way, in the leaſt tittle or point thereof;</hi> which <hi>works,</hi> if we ſhould ſuppoſe, that any one had <hi>ſo</hi> done, he would be <hi>juſtified</hi> by his <hi>works,</hi> and that of <hi>debt;</hi> for <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> ſhould not <hi>juſtifie</hi> him (with <hi>Reverence</hi> be it ſpoken) he would be <hi>unjuſt,</hi> as I have ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Whereas therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>Abraham was not juſtified by works;</hi> and that <hi>no man is juſtified by the deeds or works of the Law,</hi> and <hi>that the purpoſe of God ſhould ſtand not of works,</hi> &amp;c. It is <hi>not</hi> ſo to be underſtood, as that <hi>either</hi> Abraham, or <hi>any other</hi> had <hi>ſuch</hi> works, and yet were <hi>not,</hi> or ſhould <hi>not</hi> be <hi>juſtified</hi> by them. But it is <hi>ſo</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as that <hi>neither</hi> Abraham, nor <hi>any other,</hi> ever <hi>had, hath,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> have any <hi>ſuch works;</hi> And <hi>therefore</hi> as many as are <hi>juſtified,</hi> are <hi>juſtified without them,</hi> or though they <hi>have them not.</hi> And for <hi>this</hi> reaſon it is, that <hi>no</hi> man is ſaid <hi>to be juſtified by the works which he doth, or hath done, or ſhall do,</hi> I may add <hi>or can do,</hi> becauſe <hi>no</hi> man <hi>doth</hi> keep, <hi>hath</hi> kept, <hi>will</hi> keep, or <hi>can</hi> keep the Law, ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>exactly</hi> as the Law requireth, ſo as that he <hi>hath</hi> not, <hi>doth</hi> not, or <hi>will not</hi> break it at any time. For, <hi>our Apoſtle,</hi> to prove that <hi>no man is juſtified by the works of the Law,</hi> proves that <hi>every man hath ſinned, Rom. Chap.</hi> 1.2, 3. And therefore <hi>becauſe every man hath ſinned,</hi> no man hath <hi>works</hi> in that ſenſe which he ſpeaketh of; For if a man hath <hi>ſinned</hi> but <hi>never ſo little,</hi> he hath <hi>not works</hi> as our Apoſtle takes <hi>works</hi> in the places firſt named. For, <hi>curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> In the voice of the <hi>Law, Galat.</hi> 3.10. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Apoſtle denies</hi> plainly, that <hi>Abraham was juſtified by works,</hi> Rom. 14. verſe 1, 2. And <hi>yet</hi> Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith that <hi>he was,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father juſtified by works?</hi> James 2.21. what then? ſhall we ſay that <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>James thwarted</hi> or <hi>contradicted</hi> one the other? <hi>God forbid.</hi> For they were <hi>both</hi> led by the <hi>ſame</hi> Spirit, even <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and therefore could not <hi>erre,</hi> or <hi>contradict</hi> one the other. They take <hi>works</hi> therefore in ſeveral ſenſes, <hi>one</hi> after <hi>one</hi> ſenſe, the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59465:17"/> after <hi>another: Saint Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>works exactly done according to the command of the Law, from the very birth or infancy of a man,</hi> which <hi>works</hi> Abraham <hi>had not.</hi> But Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>ſuch works</hi> as <hi>Abraham had,</hi> and therefore not <hi>of works</hi> which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did in the <hi>firſt</hi> part of his Age, who no doubt, in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of his Age was an <hi>Idolater.</hi>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>of works</hi> which <hi>Abraham ſhould</hi> have done (if he <hi>had</hi> been juſtified by works) <hi>before</hi> his <hi>Call.</hi> Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of works which <hi>he did after</hi> his <hi>Call.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of works done <hi>without faith</hi> (for he oppoſeth <hi>ſuch works</hi> as he ſpeaks of <hi>to faith,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>works,</hi> Rom. 3.27, 28. (And it is his ſcope to prove <hi>the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of faith,</hi> becauſe no man <hi>had</hi> done, or <hi>could</hi> do <hi>ſuch works</hi>) but <hi>Saint James</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>works</hi> proceeding from <hi>faith,</hi> yea, Saint <hi>James</hi> takes <hi>works</hi> by a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> for <hi>faith</hi> it ſelf: And therefore doth he ſo do, that he may ſhew, againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> as are contented with an <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>barren</hi> faith, that <hi>juſtifying faith</hi> is an <hi>operative</hi> faith, and <hi>fruitful</hi> of good works. To the works which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>juſtification</hi> is due of <hi>debt,</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>thoſe works would not be works</hi> in his ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. and 4.4. But <hi>to the works</hi> which Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of (if we ſhould <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> they were <hi>requiſite</hi> to juſtification) <hi>juſtification</hi> would be due, not of <hi>debt</hi> but of <hi>grace.</hi> But they <hi>are not</hi> requiſite to <hi>juſtification</hi> (for they <hi>follow</hi> it) But yet they are <hi>requiſite</hi> to <hi>Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> For, <hi>If we live after the fleſh we ſhall die, but if through the Spirit we mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, we ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. But yet, <hi>though the works</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, do require, <hi>a moſt exact</hi> conformity with the Law throughout a mans <hi>whole</hi> life, without the <hi>leaſt</hi> interruption or <hi>deviation</hi> from <hi>the Law</hi> (otherwiſe a man cannot be <hi>juſtified</hi> by them) yet may a man <hi>be ſaved,</hi> though <hi>after</hi> his juſtification by faith (when the works which Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of do begin) there be <hi>ſome failer</hi> in thoſe his <hi>works,</hi> and they do not <hi>exactly</hi> anſwer the <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law.</p>

                  <p>I ſaid <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Apoſtle doth <hi>not</hi> (as I conceive) ſpeak here in his <hi>own</hi> perſon (<hi>nor</hi> yet in the perſon of a <hi>regenerate</hi> man) for reaſons which I gave in my Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on thoſe words, Ver. 14. <hi>But I am carnal, ſold under ſin.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſaid that the Apoſtle doth ſpeak here in <hi>the perſon</hi> of <hi>the People of Iſrael,</hi> or of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for it is moſt <hi>evident,</hi> that in the <hi>former</hi> part of the Chapter, he ſpoke of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they are they who he ſaid <hi>were delivered from the Law, wherein they were held that they ſhould ſerve in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> verſe 6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſaid, that he doth <hi>not</hi> here <hi>perſonate all</hi> the Jews, and <hi>therefore</hi> I ſaid it, becauſe <hi>all</hi> the Jews were not <hi>ſuch</hi> as he ſpeaks of here, to wit, <hi>carnal,</hi> and <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> and ſuch, as in <hi>whom</hi> ſin <hi>wrought all manner of concupiſcence,</hi> for it is written of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, that <hi>they were both righteous before God, walking in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1.6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe</hi> and <hi>all ſuch</hi> as theſe were, were <hi>not carnal,</hi> but <hi>spiritual,</hi> and though they lived <hi>under the Law,</hi> that is, under <hi>the obligation of the Law;</hi> yet were they <hi>not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the imperfection of the Law,</hi> for they through the <hi>Types</hi> of the Law, which were <hi>Temporal,</hi> pierced to the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of thoſe Types, which was <hi>Eternal; they</hi> were of <hi>thoſe</hi> which looked for <hi>redemption</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and which <hi>died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them a far off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them,</hi> ſo that they were <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> and yet <hi>not</hi> by <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> (though they lived <hi>under it</hi>) but of <hi>Faith</hi> and of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and I may well <hi>exempt</hi> theſe, and <hi>ſuch</hi> as theſe were, <hi>out of</hi> the number of thoſe Jews which our Apoſtle here <hi>perſonates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>yet</hi> I ſaid, that our Apoſtle doth <hi>perſonate</hi> or <hi>ſpeak</hi> here in the perſon of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> part of the Jews: For, for <hi>the greateſt</hi> part of the Jews, <hi>they</hi> were <hi>carnal and ſold under ſin;</hi> for the Jews were, for the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of them, <hi>ſuch</hi> as I ſpoke of before. And therefore <hi>ſuch</hi> as might be <hi>worſe under</hi> the Law, than <hi>without</hi> the Law; being <hi>under</hi> both the <hi>obligation</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> of the Law, and looking <hi>not</hi> to, nor <hi>beholding</hi> things <hi>eternal,</hi> but <hi>minding</hi> altogether <hi>earthly</hi> things, by reaſon of <hi>which</hi> they were <hi>adicted</hi> to the <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>pleaſures</hi> of this life.

                  <p>For whereas it is ſaid of <hi>Abijah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that there <hi>was ſome good thing found in him towards the God of Iſrael, in the houſe of Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 14.13. Why may not the <hi>like</hi> or <hi>more</hi> be ſaid of <hi>theſe</hi> Jews, <hi>whom</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here <hi>perſonates,</hi> which were <hi>better</hi> than <hi>Abijah,</hi> and are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to have atteined to the <hi>higheſt</hi> degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which <hi>any</hi> ever attained to which were under <hi>the imperfection of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, that they are ſaid <hi>to be carnal,</hi> becauſe they are ſuppoſed to have been <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,</hi> or to have been <hi>propenſe</hi> to follow <hi>whatſoever</hi> their <hi>carnal</hi> appetite and affections moved them to; but notwithſtanding this <hi>adiction</hi> or <hi>propenſion,</hi> they might <hi>ſometimes, abſtein</hi> from evil, and at <hi>ſome</hi> time or <hi>other</hi> do that which is <hi>good;</hi> though for the <hi>moſt</hi> part they neither <hi>did</hi> that which is good, nor <hi>abſteined</hi> from that which is evil.</p>
                  <p>They are ſaid alſo <hi>to be ſold under ſin,</hi> but that is (as I ſaid) by reaſon of the <hi>habits</hi> of ſins which they had contracted by <hi>long</hi> uſe and cuſtome, by reaſon of which they could <hi>not</hi> forbear to commit <hi>thoſe</hi> ſins, when they had <hi>opportunity</hi> to commit them, or were <hi>allured</hi> to them. But it is <hi>improbable,</hi> yea, <hi>impoſſible</hi> that <hi>one</hi> man ſhould have the habits of <hi>all</hi> manner of ſins, being that <hi>one</hi> ſin is often <hi>oppoſite</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to the other; Again, the <hi>opportunity</hi> of <hi>every</hi> habitual ſin, doth not offer it ſelf at <hi>all</hi> times; therefore notwithſtanding that a man is <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> he may nevertheleſs <hi>abſtein ſometimes</hi> from evil, and <hi>ſometimes do</hi> that which is good, at leaſt <hi>Secundum ſubſtantiam operis.</hi> And notwithſtanding, that that he doth <hi>ſometimes</hi> abſtein from that which is evil, and <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> do that which is good, he may <hi>be carnal and ſold under ſin.</hi>

                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. He ſayes in the perſon of the Jews aforeſaid, that <hi>in me,</hi> i. e. <hi>in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing,</hi> i. e.

                  <p>Note that he ſaith <hi>not,</hi> I know that <hi>in me,</hi> that is in <hi>my fleſh</hi> there <hi>is no good thing;</hi> but he ſaith, I know that in <hi>me,</hi> that is in my <hi>fleſh,</hi> there <hi>dwelleth</hi> no good thing. For there might <hi>be</hi> ſome good in him, as there was in <hi>Abijah</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 14.13. And yet no good <hi>dwell</hi> in him, that is, no good habit of good or virtue be in him.</p>
                  <p>As ſin is ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in a man, by reaſon of thoſe <hi>habits</hi> which cuſtome in ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb facs="tcp:59465:18"/> in him; ſo may ſuch <hi>good</hi> as is here ſpoken of, be ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in the man, in <hi>whom</hi> it is found, by reaſon of thoſe <hi>habits</hi> which <hi>custome</hi> therein produceth in him. And where either <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> dwelleth by reaſon of <hi>ſuch</hi> habits, there they may alſo be ſaid <hi>to rule</hi> reſpectively, that is, <hi>virtue</hi> where virtue or <hi>goodneſs</hi> dwelleth, and <hi>ſin</hi> where <hi>ſin</hi> dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>He proves by thoſe words, <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> that ſin dwelleth in him. For if there be no habit at all of virtue in him, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder, but that it is credible, that ſin dwelt in him.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 21. that <hi>when he would do good, evil is preſent with him,</hi> by which he meaneth, that his carnal appetite is preſent with him, moving him and inciting him to that which he cannot attain to without ſin, which would have been in a great meaſure refrained, if there had been any habitual good in him: and therefore he complains thus of it.</p>

                  <p>Nor do I conceive, that there is <hi>any ground</hi> from hence to aſſert, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be gathered together under any <hi>one</hi> viſible head, but that this Propheſie may be fulfilled in them <hi>though</hi> they ſhould live <hi>diſperſed</hi> in many parts of the world, as <hi>now</hi> they do.</p>
                  <p>That which is propheſied here of the <hi>converſion of the Jewes,</hi> our Apoſtle ſaith, ſhall be, <hi>When the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in,</hi> cap. 11. ver. 25. That is, when the <hi>full</hi> number of the Gentiles are come in, which the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſpeaks of: Or, when <hi>that</hi> number of <hi>Gentiles</hi> which God determined to bring in into his Church, before he <hi>would extend</hi> that amplitude of Grace which is here ſpoken of to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> is brought in.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>when</hi> this number or <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the Gentiles ſhall be brought in, I do <hi>not</hi> conceive, either <hi>that all</hi> and <hi>Every one</hi> of the Gentiles of the world will be then <hi>ſaved;</hi> Or that <hi>after</hi> this grace is <hi>extended</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the <hi>door</hi> of grace will be <hi>ſhut</hi> up for the ſame, to <hi>thoſe</hi> Gentiles, which ſhall then remain in their <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>unbelief:</hi> For as it is <hi>not</hi> probable, that <hi>every particular</hi> Gentile will then believe; ſo it is <hi>not</hi> probable that <hi>the extenſion</hi> of this grace of God to the Jewes will be an <hi>excluſion</hi> of the Gentiles from Gods grace, which ſhall <hi>then</hi> remain in unbelief. <hi>For if the fall of the Jewes be the Riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them be Riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulneſs?</hi> Saith our Apoſtle, <hi>verſe</hi> 12, And again, <hi>If the caſting away of the Jewes be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</hi> Verſe 15.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall adde nothing more, Gentle Reader, but here conclude this my Preface, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to be <hi>our Guide</hi> in all things, and reſt,</p>

                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Paul.]</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> is he, of whom we read <hi>Acts</hi> 9. who is there called <hi>Saul,</hi> but here <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Quaeſtion</hi> is here uſually moved, How <hi>Saul</hi> cometh to be called <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, ſome think, that he was called <hi>Saulus Paulus,</hi> that is, <hi>Saul Paul,</hi> from the time that he firſt received a name,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59465:22"/> like to that, <hi>Flavius Joſephus:</hi> and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was an <hi>Hebrew of the Hebrews (Phil.</hi> 3.5.) he was called <hi>Saul,</hi> which is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> name; and becauſe he was born a <hi>Freeman of</hi> Rome, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.28. he was called <hi>Paul,</hi> which is a <hi>Roman Name.</hi> And they think, that they are favoured, in this their opinion, by that which is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.9. <hi>Then</hi> Saul, <hi>which is alſo called</hi> Paul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But others think, that he was called <hi>Paul;</hi> not from the <hi>time</hi> that he firſt received a name: But from the <hi>time</hi> that he firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to the Gentiles (whereof the chief were <hi>Romans</hi>) and that he was then firſt called <hi>Paul,</hi> (a name uſual among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and a name not much abluding from his name <hi>Saul</hi>) by reduction of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> name <hi>Saul,</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> name <hi>Paul,</hi> which is like unto it: No reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein had to the ſignification of the words in their ſeverall Languages, but only to the literall ſound, and likeneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>And this I take as moſt probable; for it is obſerved, that he was called <hi>Saul,</hi> till ſuch time as he was <hi>ſeparated (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Holy Ghost)</hi> to the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, and entred into that Miniſtery; but upon that he was called <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. But whether <hi>Paul</hi> then changed his name himſelf, from <hi>Saul</hi> into <hi>Paul,</hi> the more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate himſelf into the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom he was ſent (the chiefeſt part whereof were <hi>Romans</hi>) or whether the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with whom he converſed, changed this name, is yet in queſtion, and ſo I leave it. Being (as it ſeems to me) a matter of no great concernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Servant of Jeſus Chriſt]</hi> If you ask who this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was: It is he of whom none of us ſhould be ignorant: It is the ſecond Perſon of the glorious Trinity, the <hi>everlaſting Son of God the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,</hi> who, that he might redeem us men out of that Abyſſe of miſery, into which we were plunged by ſin; <hi>was made fleſh, John</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14. He was <hi>made</hi> fleſh by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.20. And this name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was given him while he was yet in the womb, <hi>of God himſelf,</hi> by an Angel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. Yea, that he ſhould <hi>be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jeſus</hi> was told before he was conceived, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. And accordingly was he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed <hi>Luke</hi> 2.21. Which name ſignifieth a <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it given to him, <hi>becauſe he ſhould ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> Matth. 1.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> therefore is his <hi>proper name,</hi> and to this <hi>proper name of his,</hi> to wit, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is this name <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which ſignifieth in the Greek tongue <hi>Anointed</hi>) added. A name of <hi>Honour,</hi> and a Name of <hi>Office:</hi> for they which bore thoſe <hi>honourable Offices</hi> of <hi>King, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were called the <hi>Anointed,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>anointed</hi> with oyl at their deſignation or entry into their reſpective Offices: And as they, ſo <hi>Jeſus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe he was made a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> is here called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, the <hi>Anointed:</hi> and that either in alluſion to that, that the <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> (which were Types of him) were called <hi>Chriſtes,</hi> that is <hi>Anointed,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>Anointed</hi> (as I ſaid) with <hi>material oyl:</hi> Or, becauſe he himſelf was <hi>anointed</hi> (not with <hi>material,</hi> but <hi>immaterial oyl,</hi> that is) with the moſt excellent <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which were moſt bountifully beſtowed on him; which <hi>immaterial oyl,</hi> that is, which <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which were ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully beſtowed on him) were <hi>praefigured</hi> by that <hi>materiall oyl,</hi> with which the <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> under the Law, were anointed.</p>
               <p>He is called <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> a name partly <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and partly <hi>Greek,</hi> to ſignifie he was the Saviour both of Hebrews and Greeks, that is, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Servant of Jeſus Christ.]</hi> Every <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> is a <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> in that he is by his profeſſion to be obedient to the commandments of Chriſt; But it is not in this common Notion, that <hi>Paul</hi> calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Servant of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in this place: But therefore doth he call himſelf a <hi>Servant of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> here, becauſe he ſerved <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with his <hi>Spirit in his Goſpel,</hi> as he ſpeaketh <hi>v.</hi> 9. For what kind of Servant he was, He ſpecifieth in the next words, when he ſaith, <hi>Called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparated to the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Called to be an Apoſtle]</hi> The Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a <hi>called Apoſtle,</hi> That is, An Apoſtle (which ran not of himſelf, but) which was <hi>called</hi> to the Apoſtleſhip.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An Apoſtle]</hi> This word <hi>Apostle,</hi> is in its native ſignification, as large as the word <hi>Meſſenger</hi> is with us. But Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he calls himſelf an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> calls himſelf ſo,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59465:23"/> not in ſo large, but in a ſtricter ſignification of the word; As when our Saviour called thoſe <hi>twelve Diſciples</hi> of his (whom he choſe <hi>Luke</hi> 6.13.) <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> So that the name of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as it is taken here, is a name of <hi>Power,</hi> and a name of <hi>Dignity,</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>notes</hi> of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (as it is here taken) are theſe following;</p>
               <p>Firſt, He which was an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> was taught <hi>immediately</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He was ſent to <hi>preach the Gospel,</hi> with an <hi>immediate</hi> Commiſſion from God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Commiſſion did extend to the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> where the Goſpel was <hi>never preached</hi> before, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and plantation of Churches, where <hi>never was Church before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He had a <hi>Supereminent power</hi> over all the Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He had the <hi>Gift of Miracles</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to confirm his Doctrine, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And now if we <hi>examine</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip,</hi> according to theſe <hi>Notes,</hi> we ſhall finde, that he was truly an <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> For, <hi>firſt,</hi> He was <hi>taught immediately of God,</hi> Gal. 1. v. 11, 12. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was ſent to preach the Goſpel with an <hi>immediate Commiſſion</hi> from <hi>God Himſelf, Acts</hi> 9.15. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He had Commiſſion to preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> where <hi>it was never preached before,</hi> and to conſtitute and plant Churches, <hi>where never was Church before, Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He had a <hi>Supereminent power</hi> over <hi>all</hi> the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He had the power of Miracles, as a Seal and Sign to confirm his Doctrine and Commiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Separated to the Goſpel] i. e.</hi> Separated to the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Goſpel</hi> is put here for the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel, Per Metonymiam Subjecti. Paul</hi> was ſeperated to the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel from his Mothers womb, Gal.</hi> 1.15. And he was <hi>ſeparated</hi> again at the command of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. Though they do not much amiſs, which interpret this place of <hi>both</hi> or <hi>either</hi> of theſe <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> yet I conceive, that the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects here <hi>chiefly</hi> his <hi>ſeparation from the womb,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. q. d. <hi>Paul</hi> a Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> That is to ſay, an <hi>Apostle,</hi> called, yea ſeparated <hi>from his Mothers womb,</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> calleth himſelf a <hi>called Apoſtle,</hi> and ſaith, That he was <hi>Separated from the womb to the Goſpel,</hi> to ſhew, that he did not intrude himſelf into the <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and arrogate that Holy Function to himſelf, as ſome did who boaſted themſelves to be <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet were never called or ſeparated thereunto, which kind we read of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. As alſo that he might <hi>aſſert the Dignity</hi> of his Office, to the end, that his Epiſtle might be the better received of them to whom he wrote.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> in divers reſpects: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in reſpect of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, whereby he was God of God: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of his manner of Conception, when he took our fleſh upon him. For becauſe he was conceived by the power of <hi>the moſt High,</hi> without the help of a <hi>man,</hi> he was called <hi>The Son of God, Luke</hi> 1.35. In which ſence alſo, <hi>Adam</hi> was called <hi>The Son of God, Luke</hi> 3.38. namely, becauſe he was produced by the <hi>Supernatural</hi> power of God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he was called <hi>The Son of God,</hi> becauſe <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſanctified him, and ſent him into the world, John</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 35, 36. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he was called <hi>The Son of God,</hi> becauſe <hi>God raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, in heavenly places, Acts</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 32, 33.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask which of theſe wayes <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> is <hi>here</hi> called <hi>The Son of God,</hi> I ſay, the <hi>firſt,</hi> or in reſpect of his <hi>Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <hi>Our Lord]</hi> Chriſt is called our Lord, not onely as he was Lord of all by vertue of <hi>Creation,</hi> but alſo becauſe he <hi>bought</hi> us with a <hi>price,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. and 7.23. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.

Paul</hi> anſwereth thus, <hi>Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 35.36. which was not an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>formality</hi> of the Argument, but to the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> thereof, which was this, that <hi>The dead riſe not again:</hi> So when the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> which ſaid that <hi>there is no Reſurrection,</hi> asked our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Maſter,</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, if a Man die having no Children, his Brother ſhall marry his Wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his Brother: Now there were with us ſeven Brethren; and the firſt, when he had married a Wife, deceaſed, and having no Iſſue, left his Wife unto his Brother; likewiſe, the ſecond alſo, and the third, unto the ſeventh, and laſt of all, the Woman died alſo; therefore, in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe Wife ſhall ſhe be of the ſeven; for they all had her.</hi> O our Saviour anſwered, and ſaid unto them, <hi>As touching the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken to you by God, ſaying, I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33. In which words, our <hi>Saviour</hi> looks to the <hi>ground</hi> which moved the <hi>Sadduces</hi> to argue as they did, not to the <hi>Argument it ſelf:</hi> And if our <hi>Saviour</hi> had ſaid no more to <hi>this;</hi> nor
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59465:24"/> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> more than I have ſpoken of, to <hi>that;</hi> they had both ſufficiently anſwered thoſe that argued againſt the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Secondly, if we look back to ſome of our <hi>Saviours ſayings,</hi> and referr his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to them, his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> will not only prove him to be <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>the Son of God</hi> alſo; for before his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> he had often told the <hi>Jews</hi> that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but they would not believe him, yea, they perſecuted him for this very reaſon, becauſe <hi>He made himſelf the Son of God, John</hi> 19.7. But ſaith our Saviour, when <hi>ye have lifted me up then ye ſhall know that I am He;</hi> (that is, that I am he whom I have ſaid I am, and whom I have made my ſelf to be) <hi>John</hi> 8.28. And how could he better ſhew himſelf to be <hi>Him whom he had ſaid himſelf to be,</hi> when they had <hi>lifted</hi> him from the earth, that is, when they had crucified him and put him to death, than by <hi>raiſing</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>bringing</hi> himſelf <hi>to Life</hi> again; for that was ſufficient to confirm the truth of his words, when he gave that as a ſign and confirmation of the truth which he then ſpake. For to raiſe from the Dead, muſt needs be the work of him that could not lie, for it muſt needs be the work of him who is God.</p>

               <p>It ſeemeth by theſe words, <hi>[that I may be comforted together with you]</hi> that <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> to whom he wrote, were both afflicted at this time: for, <hi>comfort</hi> is a medicine for the <hi>afflicted:</hi> and in reſpect of the <hi>Romans,</hi> this ſeemeth probable from what we read, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.17.

               </p>
               <p>Should they not be <hi>establiſhed</hi> in the faith, but be <hi>ſhaken</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> from it, they could neither receive <hi>comfort</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> faith (for to receive <hi>comfort</hi> by the faith of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is proper only to them, which are themſelves <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and well <hi>rooted</hi> in the faith) nor could <hi>Paul</hi> receive <hi>comfort</hi> by their faith: Becauſe they had had <hi>no faith</hi> for him to take <hi>comfort</hi> in: But if they were eſtabliſhed in the faith as <hi>Paul</hi> was, they would take comfort in <hi>Pauls</hi> faith and <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>theirs.</hi> That therefore which he <hi>ſaid</hi> in the eleventh verſe, is the <hi>ſame</hi> which <hi>he</hi> ſaith here, only the <hi>tearms</hi> (as I ſaid) are more <hi>pleaſing.</hi> For it is more <hi>pleaſing</hi> for him to ſay, <hi>That he might be comforted in them,</hi> than to ſay, <hi>That they might be eſtabliſhed;</hi> and it is yet <hi>more pleaſing</hi> to ſay, <hi>That they

               <p>By what he ſaith here, he <hi>confirms</hi> yet further what he ſaid of his deſire of coming to them, <hi>v.</hi> 10.

               <p>
                  <hi>To the Greeks and to the Barbarians]</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> were wont to diſtinguiſh all the Nations of the world into <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59465:27"/> accounting all <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which were not of their own Nation: But <hi>Paul</hi> takes this diſtinction otherwiſe than the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed to do; for by the <hi>Greeks</hi> he means (by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi>) all <hi>Civiller</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the <hi>Barbarians</hi> all <hi>Ruder</hi> kind of People. I ſay, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all <hi>Civiller</hi> Nations, and ſo under that name includes the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo. For it is not likely, that he would account the <hi>Romans</hi> among <hi>Barbarians,</hi> writing to them as he doth. Therefore doth he put the <hi>Greeks</hi> for all <hi>Civiller</hi> Nations, becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> were renowned for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> now for a long time, among all <hi>Civiller Nations,</hi> and were, as it were, <hi>Maſters of Wiſdom</hi> to them all. <hi>Moreover,</hi> they <hi>ſtretched</hi> far and near, and their <hi>Language</hi> paſſed throughout all <hi>Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> Nations, as the <hi>Latin</hi> now doth.</p>

                  <hi>Both to the wiſe and to the unwiſe]</hi> Some take this to be a repetition of the former Sentence, as though by the <hi>wiſe,</hi> that is, by thoſe which are learned, the Apoſtle meant thoſe which he called <hi>Greeks;</hi> and by the <hi>unwiſe,</hi> that is, by the Illiterate, he meant thoſe which he called <hi>Barbarians:</hi> But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had rather apply thoſe words <hi>[to the Greeks and to the Barbarians]</hi> to the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> themſelves in general: and theſe words <hi>[to the wiſe and to the unwiſe]</hi> to ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe Nations.</p>

                  <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> here, than the <hi>Goſpel of God</hi> is, Becauſe the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was deſpiſed among the wiſe men of the world, (becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was <hi>crucified</hi>) and was therefore accounted a <hi>fooliſh</hi> thing: The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> therefore to ſhew, that he was not <hi>aſhamed</hi> of the Goſpel, though it <hi>concerned Chriſt,</hi> calleth it here the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> So he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. the <hi>Jews require a ſign, and the Greeks ſeek after wiſdom; But we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

               <p>And well may this be called <hi>the Power of God,</hi> for what <hi>created power</hi> can <hi>ſave</hi> us from our ſins? who hath <hi>power</hi> enough to deliver us out of the <hi>Claws of the Devil,</hi> to whom we were <hi>captive at his will?</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. who hath <hi>power</hi> to keep us ſafe from him that goeth about <hi>a roaring Lion, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he way devour?</hi> who hath <hi>power</hi> to free us from the miſeries of this mortall body? who can raiſe us up from the dead, after death? who hath power to <hi>change theſe vile bodies of ours into glorious bodies,</hi> and this corruptible of ours into incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible? who hath <hi>power</hi> to carry us up into heaven, there to enjoy bliſs for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, but <hi>God?</hi> who is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>do whatſoever he pleaſeth in Heaven and in Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Goſpel</hi> therefore is called the <hi>Power of God, Metonymically,</hi> that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>power</hi> of God is ſo <hi>joyned</hi> with it, as that God will ſo ſhew his <hi>power</hi> in ſaving them that believe it, as that he will bring them to everlaſting <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They therefore, which interpret <hi>the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God to Salvation,</hi> of a <hi>powerful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to ſave men, muſt not take it for a <hi>Phyſical</hi> inſtrument, but for a <hi>Moral</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument (as I may ſo call it) that is, for ſuch a thing with which God will ſo go along with his <hi>power,</hi> as that he will ſave them, which <hi>believe</hi> the Goſpel, even becauſe they <hi>believe</hi> it.</p>
               <p>We know that the <hi>Power of God</hi> did go along in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times with the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Goſpel, in that God did <hi>bear</hi> the preachers of it <hi>witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and gifts of the Holy-ghoſt, according to his own will, Heb.</hi> 2.4. But this is not the <hi>power</hi> here ſpoken of; (but that which we have already mentioned) for <hi>ſigns</hi> are not for thoſe which <hi>believe,</hi> but for thoſe, which <hi>believe</hi> not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. but the <hi>Power</hi> of God in this place, is for them which believe.</p>

               <p>There is a Praerogative here given to the <hi>Jew</hi> above the <hi>Gentile:</hi> which Praerogative conſiſteth in this, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and to be preached to the <hi>Jew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was preached, or to be preached to the <hi>Gentile, Acts</hi> 13.46.

               <p>That which is called Righteouſneſs, or <hi>Juſtification</hi> is alſo called <hi>Redemption, Chap.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. &amp;c.

               <p>Note that the Apoſtle doth go about here to prove that, which he ſaid before in the 16. <hi>verſe,</hi> To wit, <hi>That the Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth:</hi> But he proveth it by parts: For whereas <hi>Salvation compleat</hi> conſiſteth of <hi>two parts, juſtification,</hi> and <hi>glorification:</hi> He proves it of <hi>juſtification</hi> here in this verſe, and of <hi>glorification, Chap.</hi> 5.

               <p>Now that we may underſtand, what that <hi>Faith</hi> is, which is here required and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59465:29"/> as a <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I ſay, that the <hi>faith</hi> here required is an explicite and <hi>firm aſſent to the Goſpel of God, or at leaſt to ſo much thereof, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the New Covenant,</hi> and all the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> Parts thereof, which it pleaſed God through Chriſt to make with man in his Miſery for his Salvation, and to reveale, in the Goſpel an aſſent ſo firm, ſo ſtrong and ariſing ſo high, as that it doth immediately and infallibly ſet the Believer on work (as he hath opportunity) to do thoſe things, which God requireth on mans part to be done in that Covenant He that hath ſuch a faith cannot but truſt in God, nor can he be without repentance.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever hath ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> as this, and <hi>thus</hi> believeth, I doubt not, (from this and other the like places) but that he hath a <hi>juſtifying</hi> Faith, and that by reaſon of this his Faith, God will deal with him as with a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> Man, and as though he had never tranſgreſſed the Law of God.</p>
               <p>But I dare not call that a <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> which cometh not up to this.</p>
               <p>There be many which read <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> and give <hi>credit</hi> to the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> which they read, yet they only read them becauſe they are delighted with them, and with the various paſſages and accidents therein contained, without any regard of <hi>imitating</hi> them, or <hi>putting</hi> what they read in practice: If any one ſhould ſo <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> the Goſpel, he may be ſaid ſo have an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> but a <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi> he hath not.</p>
               <p>For <hi>good works,</hi> can no more be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from a <hi>true juſtifying faith,</hi> than <hi>light</hi> can from the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>heat</hi> can from the <hi>fire.</hi> For <hi>faith without works is dead, James</hi> 2.20. And was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father juſtified by works? ſaith Saint <hi>James, James</hi> 2.20. That is, was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by <hi>faith,</hi> ſuch a <hi>faith as produceth works?</hi> For Saint <hi>James</hi> puts <hi>works</hi> there by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> of the effect, for a <hi>faith,</hi> which produceth <hi>works.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, That <hi>faith</hi> may be conſidered two manner of wayes; <hi>Firſt, in Genere Entis; Secondly, in Genere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak <hi>In Genere Entis,</hi> that is, a <hi>true faith,</hi> which aſſenteth to the word of God as to that which is Truth: <hi>In Genere Morum,</hi> that, and that onely is a true <hi>faith,</hi> which ſo <hi>aſſenteth</hi> to the word of God, as that it ſetteth the believer infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly on good works, as he hath ſtrength and opportunity to do them. The former <hi>faith</hi> God accepteth not of, be it what it will be, and as ſtrong as may be, while it is <hi>only</hi> faith <hi>in Genere Entis,</hi> But as for the latter, that <hi>faith</hi> which is true <hi>faith in Genere Morum,</hi> God accepteth of, though it be never ſo weak, being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>

               <p>But I think the words <hi>[To faith]</hi> may be better referred to the word <hi>[revealed]</hi> than to the words immediately going before them.

               <p>Now, if <hi>Juſtification by faith</hi> be revealed <hi>for faith,</hi> That is, <hi>That men may believe.</hi> Then ought the Apoſtle to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, wherein this Juſtification is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, For how ſhall they <hi>believe,</hi> except they <hi>hear,</hi> and how ſhall they <hi>hear</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Preacher, chap.</hi> 10.14.

And therefore have theſe words this double relation, becauſe the things thereby ſignified are, <hi>One</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Other:</hi> the <hi>former</hi> of the <hi>latter:</hi> The <hi>Captivity</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> of the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> under <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and him which hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, the <hi>Devil.</hi> For it is very well known, that the <hi>Captivity</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> under <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and him, which hath the power of <hi>Death</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> And that the <hi>meſſages,</hi> and <hi>good news,</hi> which God ſent by his Prophets of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> out of the Babylonian Captivity, was a <hi>Type</hi> of the Goſpel and <hi>good newes</hi> of Mans ſalvation out of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall captivity, which was preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom God had uſed as an Inſtrument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babylonians</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by whom Man is delivered from Sin, and Death, and the Devil: And when <hi>one</hi> of theſe is propheſied of in the <hi>Letter,</hi> the other is propheſied of in the <hi>Myſterie:</hi> Yea, and while things of this nature are thus propheſied of, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth oftentimes ſo order and guide the Penman of his Propheſies, that ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages will <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>According to the literal ſence therefore, theſe words, as they lie in the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> may be thus expounded; <hi>They which are juſt, among the</hi> Babilonian <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though they are under them, from whom they may fear death through hard uſage, yea to be put to death by reaſon of their power, being Conquerors, yet if they believe the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and good newes of their deliverance by</hi> Cyrus, <hi>out of their captivity, which I ſhall ſend them by my Prophets. They ſhall be delivered from their Captivity and ſhall not die under the hands of the</hi> Babylonians, <hi>but live and live a joyfull life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the Myſtical ſence, which is the ſence in which our Apoſtle takes the words here, we may interpret theſe words thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Juſt (which believe the Goſpel) ſhall be juſtified from their ſins by their Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Juſt]</hi> According to the frequent uſe of Holy Scripture, he is called a <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>Righteous</hi> Man, [who is a man of a good and honeſt mind and deſireth to walk uprightly though he ſlips yea falls often; ſuch a man as this is, is ready to receive the meſſage of God, whenſoever it pleaſeth God to ſend it: and doth verily believe it, when it is ſent:</p>
               <p>Again if we look into the place of <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> beforementioned, <hi>to wit, Habakkuk</hi> 2.4. we ſhall find, that our <hi>juſt</hi> Man there is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him, <hi>whoſe ſoul is lifted up,</hi> that is, to a <hi>proud man;</hi> and ſo may be taken for the <hi>humble minded man,</hi> ſuch an one as <hi>truſteth</hi> not in himſelf, nor boaſteth of his own worth.

               <p>But beſides this the <hi>Juſt</hi> may be taken for him which it <hi>juſtified,</hi> and ſo may it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, when we expound the words in the myſtical ſence, <hi>q. d.</hi> He that ſhall be juſti ed, ſhall be juſtified by his Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall live]</hi> This is, as if he ſhould ſay in our Saviours words, <hi>He ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life,</hi> John 5.24. That is, <hi>he ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> that is, <hi>he ſhall be abſolved of his ſins,</hi> he ſhall <hi>not be condemned for them,</hi> though
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59465:30"/> he hath <hi>deſerved</hi> death by them.</p>
               <p>A man that is arraigned and tried for his <hi>life,</hi> upon ſome <hi>Criminal</hi> or <hi>Capital</hi> matter; If he be <hi>condemned,</hi> he is put to <hi>death:</hi> but if he be <hi>juſtified</hi> or <hi>abſolved</hi> he <hi>liveth. To live</hi> therefore, may be put here, <hi>Per Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymiam Conſequentis,</hi> for <hi>to be juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> drives at, and for which he produceth the Teſtimony of the Prophet, <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> is, (as I ſaid) to prove <hi>that righteouſneſs is of faith:</hi> or (which is the ſame) <hi>that he that believeth is accepted of God and freed from ſin, and death, which is the penalty of ſin, (not for his works ſake, but) for his faith.</hi> And to expreſſe this <hi>freedom,</hi> the Scripture, calls it ſometimes by the name of <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> (which are words borrowed from Captives, which are ſaved or redeemed, whereas, by their condition, they were as men appointed unto <hi>death.</hi>) Sometimes again (and that is the tearm moſt frequently uſed in this Epiſtle) by the name of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> which is a name or word borrowed from men (as I ſaid immediately before) accuſed of ſome Capital matter in a Court of Juſtice, where the Perſon accuſed, is acquitted or abſolved, of the crimes laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſo juſtified by the Judge and freed from the Cenſure of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> as they are here alledged by our Apoſtle, may in their Myſtical ſence, be interpreted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in alluſion to the <hi>Salvation</hi> or <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of Captives, or in alluſion to the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting, Abſolving,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification</hi> of a man, accuſed in a Court of Juſtice, of ſome Capital crime. And after which of theſe ways the Reader will interpret them, I leave to his choice; for the iſſue of both, is <hi>Life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of men]</hi> The Apoſtle prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an objection here. For whereas he ſaid, <hi>that the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Goſpel from faith:</hi> And again, it is written <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> ſignifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the way of obtaining <hi>Juſtification</hi> is by <hi>faith.</hi> A man may object and ſay, But why, <hi>Paul,</hi> doſt thou ſay, <hi>that the way of obtaining juſtification is by faith, and not by works rather,</hi> ſeeing that the Law ſaith, <hi>that the man that doth the things of the Law, ſhall live by them?</hi> To this the Apoſtle here anſwers, <hi>q. d.</hi> I therefore ſaid not, that the way of obtaining <hi>juſtification</hi> is by <hi>works:</hi> becauſe no man can <hi>be juſtified by works:</hi> for <hi>the wrath of God is revealed againſt all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſnes of men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Where note, that the Apoſtle by this his anſwer, to this objection, cometh to treat of one main <hi>Subject</hi> of this his Epiſtle, to wit, that <hi>juſtification</hi> is not by works: A way which he often uſeth, in teaching what he hath to teach. And by proving that <hi>juſtification</hi> is not by works, he doth by conſequence confirm his former Theſis, <hi>viz. that juſtification is by faith,</hi> by deſtroying that, which was moſt oppoſed againſt it, which was, <hi>juſtification by works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note here, that he which looks for <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> from his <hi>works,</hi> muſt ſo perform the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> as the <hi>Law requireth;</hi> and therefore, he muſt ſo perform them, as that he breaks not the leaſt commandment, at any time.

Now then, if a man <hi>hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> but in <hi>one ſin</hi> at any time, he cannot be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> or by <hi>Works:</hi> For the man that is <hi>juſtified</hi> is <hi>bleſſed, Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. But he that hath <hi>ſinned,</hi> though but in <hi>one</hi> ſin, and that but <hi>once,</hi> is <hi>curſed,</hi> untill he cometh to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by Faith.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Power,</hi> that is, the <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of him who made the world and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it in its being, and muſt heeds be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>great,</hi> and ſurpaſſing the power of <hi>All,</hi> but of him, who is <hi>God:</hi> For who is able to make ſo huge a Fabrique as the

               <p>When therefore we conſider, the huge Fabrique of the world, and the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof in its Being: We cannot but conclude from thence, that he which made it was of a <hi>vaſt Power,</hi> yea a <hi>Power infinite.</hi> And whereas there is no ſuch Power compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to any but to God, we conclude from thence, that he that made the world was a <hi>God,</hi> and that this <hi>God,</hi> ſheweth himſelf to be of exceeding Power, by the world which he made, and preſerveth.</p>
               <p>Yea, becauſe he ſo preſerveth the world and ſuſtaineth it, as that there is no decay therein (if we look <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>Individua,</hi> but to <hi>the Species</hi> therein contained) and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder the Perpetuity thereof, but his own Will, we may infer from that alſo, That this Power of God ſhall have no end, and therefore is <hi>Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that offers it ſelf to our Underſtanding, when we contemplate the world, and the variety of Natures therein contained, is the <hi>Power</hi> of him that made them. And from the <hi>Power</hi> of him that made the world, and all the things therein contained, we come to gather the <hi>God-head</hi> of him that made them all, or this <hi>that he is God:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Power</hi> of him, which made the world is ſuch, as that it is competible to no other, than to <hi>God:</hi> And hence it is, that the <hi>Power</hi> of God, is here put before his <hi>God-head:</hi> Though his <hi>God-head</hi> be in Nature, (as we weak men uſe to ſpeak) before his <hi>Power,</hi> if at leaſt the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But when we conſider not only the <hi>huge Fabrique</hi> of the world, but alſo <hi>how wiſely</hi> and orderly all things are <hi>governed</hi> therein, which without a Governour, would quickly come to confuſion, as a Ship without a Pilot: And when we ſee how all things are <hi>provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for; and how all things are <hi>ordered</hi> to the good and benefit of the Creature, as every one is by Nature <hi>capable</hi> of it, (of which they are moſt capable, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> is) We gather from thence, the <hi>Rule and Dominion of God</hi> over all things, as over the works of his own hands, and that the <hi>exerciſe of his Rule and Dominion</hi> is Fatherly, by which he doth not only Rule and Govern, but Provide alſo, and look to, and care for all things, which he hath made, after a Fatherly manner.</p>
               <p>And therefore note, that if by the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>God-head,</hi> as it is here taken, ſpeaks <hi>benefit</hi> to the Creature, and to man eſpecially, is to be gathered from thence, that the <hi>Heathen are ſaid to be without excuſe, for that they were not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, v.</hi> 21.

               <p>
                  <hi>This uncleanneſs,</hi> was a great diſhonor to their bodies (and ſo to them themſelves) for if he that committeth <hi>ſimple Fornication ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> againſt his body and <hi>diſhonoureth</hi> it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18.

               <p>By theſe words the Apoſtle ſuts forth the <hi>Effect</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of that encleanneſs, which he ſpoke of, and which God looked upon, when he gave them up to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. The ſence therefore of the words is this, <hi>q. d.

That by a <hi>Lie</hi> is meant <hi>That whatſoever it was, which Idolaters worſhipped inſtead of God, and was not God:</hi> And ſo is the word taken, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. And it is therefore ſo called, becauſe as a <hi>Lie</hi> though it hath oftentimes the <hi>ſhew</hi> of truth, yet it is far from truth, and hath no conformity with the thing which the words of a <hi>Lie</hi> ſignifie; So an <hi>Idoll</hi> or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is worſhipped by Idolaters inſtead of God; though it lookes <hi>like</hi> a God in the eye of an Idolater, yet it is far from <hi>being</hi> a God, and hath no <hi>conformity</hi> with the Godhead. 4. <hi>That to change the truth of God into a lie,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>to embrace, in the ſtead of the true God, that which is not true God.</hi> Of which Phraſe See <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>But we are ſure that the judgment of God is according to truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things]</hi> Between this and the foregoing verſe, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the <hi>Jew</hi> hearing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſay, that he <hi>(to wit)</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> condemned himſelf, in that wherein he judged the <hi>Gentile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did the ſame things, grew <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> for that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> made no <hi>difference</hi> between a <hi>Gentile</hi> and him which was a <hi>Jew;</hi> and broke out into theſe or the like <hi>words, But what, if I condemn the Gentile, for doing thoſe unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, which you reckoned up, muſt I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemn my ſelf? Is there no difference between a Gentile and me? A Gentile, he is of an unclean Stock; he is blind and ignorant, and uncircumciſed by nature, but I am a Jew by Birth, and therefore one of that holy People, which the Lord the God choſe to be a ſpecial People to himſelf, Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>And I am skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Laws and Statutes, which God gave to us, but not to the Gentiles, Pſalm</hi> 147.19. <hi>And I am circumciſed with that circumciſion, which is a token of the Covenant, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>I may therefore condemn a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and yet not condemn my ſelf, though I had committed the ſame things, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this Obiection of the <hi>Jew,</hi> doth the Apoſtle here anſwer, <hi>q. d. Thou O Jew art partial in paſſing thy Sentence: For though thou condemneſt the Gentile for the ſins, which he committeth: yet thou wilt not give judgment againſt thy ſelf, (though thou thy ſelf doeſt the ſame things, which the Gentile doth) But yet, we are ſure, that the judgment of God is according to truth, againſt all them which commit ſuch things: And therefore, it is as well againſt thee, who art a Jew, and art inſtructed in the Law, and art circumciſed, as it is againſt a Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> here, that it is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſual manner of teaching, to teach by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>tacite, Objections</hi> and <hi>Queſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief Scope of the Apoſtle, in the firſt part of this his Epiſtle is, to ſhew, That <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> is not by the <hi>works of the Moral Law:</hi> Yet becauſe the <hi>Jew</hi> thought that he might be <hi>juſtified</hi> (though he had not obſerved the <hi>Moral</hi> Law,) by being a <hi>Jew,</hi> (that is, by being a Child of <hi>Abraham) Matth.</hi> 3.9. And by the <hi>knowledge</hi> and skill, that he had in the <hi>Law:</hi> And by his <hi>circumciſion,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle doth by the bie,</hi> as he hath occaſion, confute this conceit alſo: That he might ſhew that a man is juſtified by Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are ſure] i. e.</hi> We who have the Spirt of the Lord: or we who have the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods word, and the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, we are ſure.</p>

                  <hi>According to truth] i. e.</hi> According to the true <hi>doings</hi> of men, without any <hi>reſpect</hi> to their perſons.

And to them which have done <hi>evil, evil</hi> things, as <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> and <hi>anguiſh, v.</hi> 9. And to thoſe, which have done <hi>better,</hi> than other good men, will he give a <hi>greater</hi> meaſure of good things; and to thoſe who have done <hi>worſe</hi> than other evill men. He will give a <hi>greater</hi> meaſure of evill things. Thus will he give to every man <hi>according</hi> to his deeds: And thus muſt we interpret this his retribution, <hi>not,</hi> as though he were ſaid ſo to render to every one <hi>according</hi> to his works, ſo as that the Godly man, or man that did well, ſhould <hi>have no more</hi> than he deſerved, for his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ſhall infinitely <hi>exceed</hi> his works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who will render to every one according to his deeds]</hi> It may be asked (by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.) That if God ſhould render to every man <hi>according</hi> to his deeds; and there is no man but hath ſinned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. And every man which hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is curſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.10. How could any one look for honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and receive eternal life?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that if we ſpeak of good works, and ſhould meaſure them according to the <hi>Strict Rule</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> No man could be <hi>ſaved,</hi> or ever receive eternal life by <hi>vertue</hi> of his deeds.</p>
               <p>And according to this <hi>Rule</hi> Repentance would do him little good, becauſe he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59465:39"/> had once ſinned, and ſo continued not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.10 But this, is not the <hi>Rule,</hi> by which all men ſhall be judged at the laſt day: For they which believe the Goſpel, ſhall be judged by the Goſpel, which (through Chriſt, and for his merits ſake applied to us) is a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Rule,</hi> and accepts of <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> ſins, upon repentance, and takes off the <hi>curſe</hi> of the Law, and promiſeth eternal life to them that walk according to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And therefore he that walks according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and performs his part in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is a <hi>Gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> may through Chriſt, hope for <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> by thoſe his deeds though he hath ſinned, and that not in <hi>vain.</hi> For he ſhall be crowned at length with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, (though he could not be <hi>ſaved</hi> if his deeds were to be examined <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and he judged according to the ſtrict <hi>rigour</hi> of the Law) For God, who is the only Law-giver, who hath power to ſave and to deſtroy, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. He hath cancelled the rigid Law, as to Believers, and ſet them the Goſpel, to be the only Rule, for them to walk by now, and to be judged by at the laſt day, through the merits of Chriſt</p>
               <p>A Queſtion more here may be asked; for one may ſay, the Judgment which the Lord will execute at the laſt day towards all men, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous Judgment, v.</hi> 5. How therefore can that <hi>Judgment,</hi> by which he ſhall adjudge Believers to eternal life, be called a <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>righteous</hi> Judgment, whereas there is no Believer but hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore deſerved everlaſting death.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, though the <hi>Judgment</hi> by which God ſhall adjudge the Believers to <hi>Eternal</hi> life, cannot be ſaid to be <hi>juſt</hi> in that <hi>ſence,</hi> as that the Believer doth <hi>deſerve</hi> eternal life, by the worth of his works, and that God would be unjuſt, if he did not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him: Yet it may be ſaid to be <hi>juſt,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>promiſe</hi> of eternal life, which God hath graciouſly made to all Believers, for the merits of Chriſt, in the Goſpel. For there is <hi>Juſtice</hi> in keeping of <hi>promiſes:</hi> and a <hi>promiſe</hi> gives a <hi>right</hi> to that, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>promiſe</hi> no <hi>right</hi> could be claimed. Moreover, in this caſe, the <hi>merits</hi> of Chriſt ſupply the <hi>defect</hi> of man: and for his ſake he may be accounted <hi>worthy</hi> of eternal life, who is not <hi>worthy</hi> thereof for his own.

               <p>By <hi>patient</hi> continuance, or perſeverance in well doing, is meant, <hi>ſuch continuance,</hi> or <hi>perſeverance</hi> in doing well, as no <hi>croſs,</hi> or <hi>perſecution,</hi> or <hi>diſcouragement</hi> can break off.</p>
               <p>And <hi>by well doing,</hi> is meant, not that <hi>ſtrict</hi> obſervance of the Law, which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: for who can do that? but ſuch well doing, as the <hi>faithful,</hi> and believers perform, which <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> to walk in all pleaſing to God, though they ſometimes <hi>ſtumble,</hi> and <hi>fall:</hi> That is, ſuch <hi>well doing</hi> as is required of them, and they perform, which believe the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doeſt thou commit ſacriledge?] Sacriledge</hi> is a ſin by which an <hi>holy</hi> thing is violated. And it is committed, when that which is <hi>holy</hi> is ſtoln, or unlawfully taken out of an <hi>holy Place,</hi> or, when that which is <hi>not holy</hi> is ſtoln, or unlawfully taken out of a <hi>Place</hi> that <hi>is holy,</hi> or, when that which is <hi>holy</hi> is ſtoln, or unlawfully taken out of a Place which is <hi>not holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sacriledge</hi> here imputed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is likely to have conſiſted in that, That ſome did defraud the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> of their <hi>Tithes,</hi> and ſuch things as were due unto them by the Law: and others did take thoſe things, which were <hi>Dedicated</hi> to the uſe of the Temple, and convert them to their own <hi>private</hi> uſe.</p>
               <p>It may be asked here, why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, Thou that abhorreſt <hi>Idols,</hi> doeſt thou commit <hi>Sacriledge?</hi> whereas he ſaid before, thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not <hi>ſteal,</hi> doeſt thou <hi>ſteal?</hi> thou that ſaiſt a man ſhould not commit <hi>adultery,</hi> doeſt thou commit <hi>adultery?</hi> For are <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi> the ſame things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Idolatry</hi> is a ſpiritual kind of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,</hi> for it <hi>takes</hi> away from God the <hi>honour</hi> which is holy to him. Therefore might the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſay, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doeſt thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Thou that abhorreſt <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in one kind, doeſt thou commit <hi>it</hi> in <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the reaſon, why the <hi>Jews</hi> abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Idols,</hi> was, becauſe <hi>Idols</hi> were injurious to the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God: and as <hi>Idolatry</hi> is <hi>injurious</hi> to Gods <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;</hi> ſo is <hi>Sacriledge too;</hi> (Read <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.) When therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith: <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doeſt thou commit Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> It is as if he ſhould ſay; Thou that abhorreſt <hi>Idols</hi> becauſe they are <hi>injurious</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, doeſt thou commit <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> which is <hi>injurious</hi> to the ſame <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law] i. e.</hi> Thou that makeſt thy boaſt, that God hath given thee his Law, and ſo honoured thee above the Gentiles, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147.19. Or, thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the knowledge, which thou haſt in the Law, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It was no <hi>contemptible</hi> Priviledge, which God gave to the <hi>Jew</hi> above the <hi>Gentile,</hi> in giving him the <hi>Law,</hi> (Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 8. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20) Therefore no wonder, that the <hi>Jew</hi> boaſteth of it, and of his knowledge therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God?] i. e.</hi> Doeſt thou break the Law, which thou boaſteſt of, and ſo <hi>diſhonoureſt</hi> God the <hi>giver</hi> of it? <hi>q. d.</hi> Doeſt thou turn that, in which thou <hi>glorieſt,</hi> to the <hi>diſhonour</hi> of him, which is the <hi>Author</hi> thereof, and ſhould receive <hi>Glory</hi> thereby?</p>
               <p>As <hi>God</hi> is <hi>honoured</hi> by our <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>Law:</hi> So is he <hi>diſhonoured</hi> by the <hi>diſobedience</hi> which is thereto offered: For the <hi>breach of a Law,</hi> turns to the <hi>contumelie</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> of the <hi>Law-maker:</hi> And it makes <hi>unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to ſpeak <hi>ill</hi> of him, who giveth the Law, when they to whom he gave it thus break it; For they think, that either he did <hi>delight</hi> in, or <hi>connive at wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>forbid</hi> it only in a kind of <hi>formality,</hi> or that he did not ſee it, or that he was not able to puniſh it, if he ſaw it, and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> after that he hath inſtanced in ſome particular ſins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> contrary to their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> (whereby they were made more liable to judgment, than otherwiſe they would be) wraps up the reſt in this <hi>General, Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, by breaking of the Law diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt thou God?</hi>

               <p>How theſe words are applied by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to his preſent purpoſe, may be asked.</p>
               <p>Moſt <hi>Interpreters</hi> think, that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only by <hi>Accommodation,</hi> which is, when words are only uſed for the preſent purpoſe, without any relation to the matter which <hi>is</hi> handled in that place, from whence the words are taken: As if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould ſay, Through breaking the Law diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> may alledge that place of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> as a <hi>reall</hi> proof, to prove that the <hi>Name</hi> of God was <hi>blaſphemed,</hi> that is, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured</hi> and <hi>evil ſpoken</hi> of among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> by reaſon of the ſins of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The blaſphemy which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh of, was that, by which the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or living among them, did <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> the true God. But this <hi>blaſphemy</hi> was <hi>occaſioned,</hi> partly by the fault of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were then in Captivity to the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> for many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> lived not ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> as their <hi>Religion</hi> required; and when <hi>God</hi> ſent his Prophets to tell them in his Name, that he would <hi>deliver</hi> them out of the hands of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they conſidering the great <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> (who lay heavy upon them) more than they did the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> of God, would not <hi>believe</hi> the word of the Lord; which made the <hi>Babylonians</hi> to think and ſay, that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a <hi>wicked</hi> God, becauſe his Servants were wicked. And that he was a poor <hi>weak</hi> God in reſpect of them, becauſe he was not <hi>able</hi> to deliver his <hi>Servants</hi> out of their hands, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did his <hi>Servants</hi> think him <hi>able</hi> to do it.</p>
               <p>This then was ſpoken by the Prophet of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were moved to blaſpheme God, by the evil carriage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which lived in the time of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity.</p>
               <p>But thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in the time of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, might be in reſpect of their evil carriage, a <hi>Type</hi> of thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> which lived in the time of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and ſo what is <hi>litterally</hi> or <hi>hiſtorically</hi> ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> touching <hi>them</hi> of that time, might be <hi>Prophetically</hi> ſpoken by him of thoſe which lived in the time of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And ſo our Apoſtle may take it.</p>
               <p>For proof of this, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>one</hi> time, may be <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>another</hi> time, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews</hi> of his time wherein he lived, ſaith in the Perſon of God, <hi>This people draweth near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the Precepts of men, Iſa.</hi> 29.13. Now what the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith there, is plain that he ſaith <hi>litterally</hi> or <hi>hiſtorically</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>time</hi> in which he lived. Yet becauſe (as it ſeems) theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were a <hi>Type</hi> of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, theſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are taken not only as an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> narration, of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s dayes, but alſo as a <hi>Propheſie</hi> concerning thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in the dayes of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for thus ſaith our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Well did Iſaiah propheſie of you, ſaying; This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

               <p>Another <hi>Queſtion</hi> may here be asked, and it is this; Being that the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was abrogated, when the Apoſtle wrote this, and <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was a Ceremony, how can Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to the <hi>Jew</hi> as he doth here, <hi>Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keep the Law?</hi>

               <p>Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> we may ſay, That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this his diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> though he may ſeem to tax, only the <hi>Jews</hi> of his own time, yet he taxeth all thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, which lived under the <hi>Law,</hi> which thought they ſhould be ſaved through <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and when he ſpeaks to the <hi>Jew,</hi> he ſpeaks by a <hi>Proſopopoeia</hi> or <hi>Syllep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to them <hi>all,</hi> both <hi>dead</hi> &amp; <hi>living, collective:</hi> The far <hi>greateſt</hi> part thereof, being that they <hi>lived</hi> when the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was in force, he may ſay to them in general, <hi>Circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keep the Law.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, &amp;c.]</hi> The Apoſtle prevents an Objection here. For whereas he ſhewed from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to <hi>ver.</hi> 24 That a Jew, which had the knowledge of the Law, being that he ſinned; his ſin was greater than his, who was not a Jew, and had not the knowledge of the Law.

That if he kept not the Law, but was a breaker of the Law, his circumciſion (which he ſo much truſted in) was made uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. That the uncircumciſed Gentile, if he keep the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law, his uncircumciſion ſhould be counted for circumciſion; yea, He ſhould judge the Jew, who having both circumciſion and the Law did tranſgreſs the Law. A Jew might object ſaying, But how can this be <hi>Paul,</hi> that the caſe of a Jew, can be ſo bad as thou makeſt it, though he doth ſin? Or how can it be that his circumciſion, ſhould become uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, if he keep not the Law? And how ſhould the uncircumciſion of the Gentiles, if they keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law, be counted for circumciſion? And how ſhould an uncircumciſed Gentile, which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the Law, judge a Jew, which hath the Law and circumciſion, if he tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Law? For knoweſt not thou, that a Jew is in high reſpect and favour with God, as being a Child of <hi>Abraham</hi> the friend of God? and that circumciſion is highly reſpected and favoured of God, as being given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a ſign of his favour, and a Seal of the covenant, which he made with him and with his ſeed, whoſe ſeed the Jews are?</p>
               <p>This objection, I ſay, the Apoſtle prevents, by granting that which a carnal Jew might object concerning a Jew; and concerning cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but diſtinguiſhing between a Jew, and a Jew, and between circumciſion, and circumciſion, <hi>q. d.</hi> For though I grant you, that a Jew is in high favour with God, and that circumciſion is highly reſpected of him; yet, <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion, which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh, but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the Heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly] q. d.</hi> For though a Jew be highly favoured of

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> did therefore think himſelf high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured by God, and ſo free from <hi>judgement,</hi> becauſe he was of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (for every Jew is a Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> according to the fleſh) but ſee what was ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 17. concerning the <hi>Jew.</hi>)</p>
               <p>He is ſaid to be a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> who is a <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> onely, according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and appears to be ſo by his <hi>Genealogie,</hi> and by enjoying the <hi>outward</hi> Priviledges of ſuch as were children of <hi>Abraham</hi> carnally.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That of the heart] i. e.</hi> That whereby the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>circumciſed</hi> from ſins and <hi>dead</hi> works, as from <hi>unbelief</hi> and the like, and that only, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But <hi>others</hi> had rather take the <hi>Spirit</hi> here, for that principal part of man, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is <hi>a Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Letter,</hi> for that <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> in which <hi>circumciſion</hi> was to be made by the Praeſcript of the <hi>Letter. that is,</hi> by the Praeſcript of the <hi>Law,</hi> (by a <hi>Metonymie</hi>) which <hi>Preſcript</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> or foreskin to be <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſe praiſe is not of Men but of God] i. e.</hi> Which <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is <hi>praiſ-worthy,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> only can give it its <hi>due praiſe,</hi> and not <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> only can give this <hi>Circumciſion</hi> its due <hi>praiſe,</hi> becauſe being it is in the <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Soul, God</hi> only can <hi>ſee</hi> whether it be <hi>true</hi> or no; for <hi>he</hi> only is <hi>the ſearcher of the Reins and Heart, Revel.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. And therefore <hi>he</hi> can <hi>only</hi> ſee whether it be <hi>worthy of praiſe</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>By what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks here in theſe two laſt verſes, he would draw off the <hi>Jew</hi> from thoſe <hi>vain conceits</hi> which he had, to embrace the <hi>faith,</hi> and therein to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a true <hi>Jew,</hi> that is, a <hi>true</hi> Son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> indeed; and a man <hi>circumciſed</hi> with <hi>that Circumciſion,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> reſpecteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were very <hi>incredulous</hi> and <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> at all times, and we finde them often <hi>taxed</hi> for this ſin of <hi>unbelief, as Deut.</hi> 1.32. and 9 23. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.14. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.32 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.24. and (which makes in its myſtical ſence greatly to this place) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1.

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, though they <hi>reject Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and all his <hi>benefits,</hi> yet they ſay, that they <hi>receive</hi> the Oracles of God, and <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>promiſes</hi> therein, made to their Fathers, concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> for they <hi>look</hi> for a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, though they <hi>reject Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and acknowledge him not to be the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

               <p>That wherein the <hi>unbelief</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> was ſeen, was that, that they believed not the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God made to them, or to their <hi>Fathers:</hi> And that wherein the <hi>faith</hi> of God was ſeen, is this, that <hi>God,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their <hi>unbelief,</hi> was as good as his word, and performed to them, what he promiſed, either to <hi>them,</hi> or to their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

               <p>What therefore were the <hi>promiſes</hi> that God made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to their Fathers? He promiſed to their Fathers and ſo to them, that <hi>He would be a God to them and

               <p>He promiſed that <hi>He would not caſt them away, neither would he abhor them to deſtroy them utterly, Levit.</hi> 26.44.

               <p>And <hi>this ſence</hi> is moſt agreable to the ſence of the Place.

                  <hi>With their tongue they have uſed deceit] i. e.</hi> They ſpeak <hi>deceitfully</hi> and <hi>guilefully</hi> with their tongues; for their <hi>words</hi> are <hi>fair,</hi> but their <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>foul,</hi> they ſpeak <hi>fair</hi> with their <hi>mouth,</hi> but bear <hi>miſchief</hi> in their <hi>heart,</hi> and would <hi>entrap</hi> the Innocent to deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> tranſlated word for word, is, <hi>They flatter with their tongue;</hi> but being they <hi>flattered</hi> for this <hi>end,</hi> that they might <hi>entrap</hi> with their <hi>tongue,</hi> They (as the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi> renders it) have uſed <hi>deceit.</hi>

                  <hi>Through faith in his blood]</hi> Note here, that <hi>Faith,</hi> when it is joyned with <hi>In,</hi> as here it is, ſignifieth for the moſt part, <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> or <hi>Relying upon</hi> a thing: And here it ſignifieth, <hi>Truſt</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying</hi> upon the blood of Chriſt; And truly, he that doth <hi>believe</hi> the Goſpel, and the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> therein recorded, as he ought to do, cannot but <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confide,</hi> in the <hi>death</hi> or <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>relye</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; Hence it is, that ſuch kind of <hi>phraſes</hi> as theſe: <hi>The faith of,</hi> and <hi>Faith from,</hi> are often <hi>confounded</hi> in Scripture, and <hi>taken</hi> for one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To declare his Righteouſneſs]</hi> The word <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſignifieth here <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, as will appear by the following verſe, where it is repeated. And it is frequent, for <hi>one</hi> word thus to carry with it <hi>two</hi> ſignifications; but more of this in the <hi>next</hi> verſe.</p>
               <p>Note, that theſe words <hi>[To declare his Righteouſneſs]</hi> depend on thoſe <hi>[Whom he hath ſet forth]</hi> and ſhew the <hi>final</hi> cauſe, or <hi>end</hi> of that, <hi>That God ſet forth a Propitiator,</hi> which was to ſhew that he <hi>was righteous,</hi> for, or, by remitting of ſins.</p>

                  <hi>For the remiſſion of ſins which are paſt] i. e.</hi> For that he remitteth the ſins which are paſt. The words in the Original are theſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>According therefore to the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>firſt,</hi> the words muſt run thus, <hi>For the remiſſion of ſins which are paſt,</hi> and then they are to be referred to thoſe words, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation,</hi> and there muſt be a <hi>Comma</hi> between <hi>theſe,</hi> and the words which <hi>go immediately</hi> before them, for they ſignifie a more ſpecial <hi>end,</hi> why God did ſet forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,</hi> He did it <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the <hi>Second</hi> interpretation, the words muſt run thus, <hi>Through the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins which are paſt,</hi> and then they are to be referred to the words <hi>immediately</hi> going before, and ſhew how <hi>God</hi> was declared to be <hi>Righteous:</hi> He was declared to be <hi>Righteous,</hi> by the <hi>remiſſion of ſins which are paſt;</hi> or, <hi>In</hi> remitting of <hi>ſins</hi> which were <hi>paſt:</hi> For <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins declare <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>Righteous,</hi> that is, to be <hi>merciful,</hi> for it is <hi>mercy</hi> in God to <hi>forgive</hi> ſins, whereas he might puniſh the ſinner with <hi>eternal</hi> death: and <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> declare God to be <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> that is, <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> becauſe, whereas <hi>God</hi> did ſay, and promiſe, <hi>That he would forgive ſins;</hi> by the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins, he did <hi>ſhew</hi> himſelf to be as <hi>good as his word.</hi>

               <p>He mentioneth <hi>only</hi> thoſe ſins which were committed under the <hi>Law,</hi> not becauſe <hi>God gave</hi> a Propitiation for remiſſion of thoſe ſins <hi>only,</hi> and not for the remiſſion of the ſins <hi>committed</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> But that he might <hi>ſhew,</hi> the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>Old Law,</hi> of which the <hi>Jews</hi> (with whom he hath to do, for a great part in this his Epiſtle) did <hi>glory:</hi> And that he might declare, that thoſe <hi>Expiations</hi> or <hi>Purgations,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the <hi>Law,</hi> were not <hi>true</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Expiations indeed, but only <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> of true Purgations and Expiations: For <hi>it is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſin, Heb.</hi> 10.4.</p>

                  <hi>Through the forbearance of God] i. e.</hi> And which God hath not <hi>puniſhed</hi> with any <hi>dreadful</hi> puniſhment (not by <hi>reaſon</hi> of that that they did <hi>not deſerve dreadful</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor by reaſon of that, that they were <hi>expiated</hi> and purged by other means than by the <hi>blood of Chriſt,</hi> but) through his <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>therefore</hi> did <hi>God forbeare</hi> to puniſh the ſins of men, committed under the <hi>Law,</hi> according to their <hi>deſert</hi> becauſe he had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,</hi> to ſet forth a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for thoſe their <hi>ſins</hi> in his good <hi>time,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Time of the Goſpel:</hi> A <hi>Propitiation</hi> which ſhould <hi>reach</hi> even to <hi>ſins</hi> committed under the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words therefore there is an <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſis,</hi> and theſe words contain a prevention of an Objection which a <hi>Jew</hi> might make.

               <p>To this therefore the <hi>Apostle anſwers,</hi> That it was not <hi>becauſe</hi> they had <hi>not</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch ſins, nor <hi>becauſe</hi> their ſins were <hi>expiated</hi> and purged by the <hi>Law,</hi> that God had not <hi>puniſhed</hi> them in any <hi>grievous</hi> manner, but it was becauſe of his <hi>forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and long ſuffering.</hi> Note, that Chriſt was not a Propitiation for <hi>all ſins,</hi> which were <hi>paſt;</hi> but only for the ſins paſt of ſuch as <hi>repented;</hi> whoſe ſins God puniſhed not, ſo ſoon as they were committed, and for Gods <hi>forbearance</hi> to <hi>them, others</hi> which <hi>repented not</hi> did fare the better, in that God did <hi>forbear</hi> them, and the ſins of them which repented he <hi>puniſhed</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 26. <hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his Righteouſnes]</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reſumes here, what he ſpoke in the former verſe, the better to <hi>explain</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> is to be taken here, both for the <hi>Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> and for the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, as I ſaid before: For what he meaneth by <hi>Declaring the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> he expoundeth by thoſe words <hi>[that he might be juſt and the juſtifier of him, which believeth in Jeſus]</hi> Where, <hi>to be just,</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God in keeping his <hi>word; To be the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus,</hi> ſheweth the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Of that, that the word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is ſometimes taken for <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> we have an example <hi>verſe</hi> 5. Of that, that the word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is taken for <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> we have an example, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.</p>
               <p>It <hi>may</hi> be that the Apoſtle ſaith of God, <hi>That he granted remiſſion of ſins,</hi> that he might appear <hi>juſt,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God made to their <hi>Fathers,</hi> that he would (upon their ſaith and repentance) give them <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins.</p>

                  <hi>By what Law]</hi> The word <hi>Law</hi> is to be taken here in a more <hi>Lax,</hi> and <hi>Generall</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification than <hi>commonly</hi> it is taken. For here are two <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> (as it is here uſed) mentioned in this place; The <hi>Law of works</hi> and the <hi>Law of faith,</hi> whereof the <hi>Law</hi> of works is properly and moſt uſually called the <hi>Law,</hi> and is ordinarily oppoſed to the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and the other is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it is oppoſed to the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo ſtrictly taken.</p>

                  <hi>Of Works] i. e.</hi> By the <hi>Law</hi> of works?</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Law</hi> is here to be underſtood, from that which went before.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the Law of Works</hi> is meant, that <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which teacheth that a <hi>Man,</hi> which is actually <hi>Juſtified,</hi> is <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>works</hi> of the Law, and that he that would be <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> muſt be <hi>thereby</hi> juſtified, which cannot be, except <hi>a man</hi> hath moſt exactly kept the whole <hi>Law,</hi> and never failed in any <hi>Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> thereof, at any time.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And indeed it implieth a <hi>contradiction</hi> to ſay, that a <hi>juſtified</hi> man, or a <hi>man,</hi> that is actually <hi>juſtified</hi> according to the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> is excluded from <hi>boaſting,</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> of Works: For he that is <hi>juſtified</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law</hi> of Works (with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be it ſpoken) is not beholding to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>juſtification,</hi> for he hath perfectly <hi>obſerved the Law</hi> in every <hi>Apex, Tittle,</hi> and <hi>Jot</hi> of it, ſo that <hi>God</hi> (who is <hi>juſt</hi> in his judgement) when he is brought before his <hi>Tribunal</hi> as a <hi>Tranſgreſſour</hi> of the Law, muſt needs <hi>juſtifie</hi> him, that is, muſt needs <hi>acquit</hi> him and pronounce him <hi>guiltleſs:</hi> and God would be <hi>unjuſt</hi> if he did not ſo.

                  <hi>But by the Law of Faith]</hi> That Law, <hi>that is,</hi> that doctrine which teacheth, that a man is <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> doth <hi>exclude boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59465:59"/> and takes away the cauſe or ground of <hi>boaſting,</hi> from a <hi>juſtified</hi> man: For it <hi>teacheth,</hi> that he that is <hi>juſtified</hi> according to <hi>that,</hi> hath <hi>ſinned,</hi> and therefore, if he be <hi>juſtified,</hi> he is <hi>juſtified</hi> by Grace, that is, by the <hi>meer favour</hi> and mercy of God, which cannot ſtand with <hi>boaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It teacheth, <hi>I ſay,</hi> that every man hath <hi>ſinned,</hi> and ſo that every man is under the <hi>Curſe,</hi> for <hi>curſed is every one, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Deut 27.25. Galat. 3.10. And being now <hi>curſed,</hi> he cannot get out from under that <hi>curſe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>favour</hi> and mercy of <hi>God:</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>broken</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> he cannot be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> for that implies a <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And therefore, if he be <hi>juſtified,</hi> he muſt be <hi>juſtified</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo by the meer <hi>grace</hi> and favour of <hi>God,</hi> with which boaſting cannot <hi>conſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles <hi>ſcope</hi> in this verſe, is (as I ſaid) as to <hi>repreſs</hi> the vain <hi>boaſting</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo to take men off, from ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>juſtification</hi> by <hi>works,</hi> or by the works of the Law, and to bring them to <hi>ſeek</hi> after juſtification <hi>by Faith:</hi> and his Argument is valid to this purpoſe, upon ſuppoſition (which yet he hath proved to be a moſt certain <hi>Truth</hi>) that <hi>all have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if <hi>all men have ſinned</hi> (which is an undeniable truth, and which the doctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> teacheth) then no man can <hi>boaſt</hi> before God, for whoſoever hath <hi>ſinned,</hi> hath need of the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God: And whoſoever receives any thing of the <hi>grace</hi> and favour of God, cannot <hi>boaſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>Now, if thou canſt <hi>not boast,</hi> thou ſeekeſt in vain to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the works of the <hi>Law;</hi> for no man can be juſtified by the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> but he which keepeth the Law, and hath always kept it in every point: And he, that <hi>keeps</hi> it ſo, may <hi>boaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore being thou canſt not <hi>boaſt,</hi> ſeek not for <hi>juſtification</hi> by the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> which makes them <hi>boaſt,</hi> which are <hi>juſtified</hi> thereby; but <hi>ſeek</hi> for it by <hi>faith.</hi> For though thou canſt not <hi>boast,</hi> and ſo canſt not be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the works of the <hi>Law,</hi> yet thou mayeſt be <hi>juſtified by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not unlikely, but that among the <hi>Jews</hi> (which were <hi>blinded</hi> by reaſon of their <hi>unbelief, Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.) There were ſome, who (though they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that they could not boaſt, yet) did ſeek for <hi>juſtification</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> not perceiving how incompatible theſe two things are, <hi>Not to boaſt, or not to have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of boaſting,</hi> and to be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But by the Law of Faith]</hi> Note, that whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might have ſaid thus; <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded: By what? By Works? Nay, but by Faith.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. By what Law? of works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this he doth by a <hi>Mimeſis</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and repeating the word <hi>Law,</hi> that he might in a <hi>ſlighting</hi> manner imitate the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did <hi>crack</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and had the <hi>Law</hi> alwayes in their <hi>mouths,</hi> though they kept it not; <hi>intimating</hi> thereby, that if they <hi>gloried</hi> in the word <hi>Law,</hi> he could ſay, that they, which were <hi>Juſtified,</hi> were juſtified by a <hi>Law</hi> too; but not by the <hi>Law,</hi> which they <hi>cracked</hi> of, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Law of Works;</hi> but by a <hi>Law</hi> differing from that, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Law of <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 28. <hi>We conclude therefore, that a man is juſtified by faith]</hi> This concluſion, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> draws, not from the verſe <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> going before, but from his <hi>whole</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which he hath had from the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> of the firſt Chapter of this Epiſtle hitherto, and eſpecially from that, which he taught, and diſcourſed of <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>

               <p>For <hi>God to be the God of any one,</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie, that <hi>God is held as a God, and worſhipped and obeyed as a God of him, whoſe God he is ſaid to be:</hi> In this ſence <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Lord ſhould be his God, Gen.</hi> 28.21. Sometimes again, (and that moſt frequently) for <hi>God to be the God of any one,</hi> ſignifieth, that <hi>God</hi> is an <hi>Egregious Benefactor</hi> of him, whoſe <hi>God</hi> he is ſaid to be: In which ſence it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is the Nation whoſe God is the Lord, Pſalm</hi> 33.12 And in which ſence <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Exod</hi> 3.6. And in which ſence God ſaith, that he would be a <hi>God to</hi> Abraham <hi>and to his Seed after him, Gen.</hi> 17.7. Now of theſe two ſences; the latter is that in which <hi>God</hi> is ſaid here to be a <hi>God of the Jews,</hi> and not of the Jews <hi>only,</hi> but of the Gentiles <hi>alſo:</hi> For <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Benefactor</hi> to them both, not only in <hi>Temporal</hi> bleſſings, but in <hi>Spiritual</hi> bleſſings alſo, and in ſuch as concern Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaketh by an <hi>Interrogative</hi> here, firſt to ſignifie, that the <hi>thing</hi> which he ſpeaks of is ſo <hi>plain,</hi> as that it cannot be <hi>denied: Secondly,</hi> to take up the <hi>Jews</hi> a little, who entertained a <hi>baſe</hi> eſteem of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <p>As for the <hi>Connexion</hi> of this verſe <hi>with</hi> what went before, It is this; <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. That a <hi>Man</hi> is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law, where he took the word <hi>Man indefinitely,</hi> for <hi>men</hi> of any Nation, by reaſon therefore of <hi>that</hi> word, he had a good opportunity given him to ſpeak to the <hi>Jew,</hi> of the good will of God towards the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> from <hi>that</hi> therefore he inferreth this Corollary, <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, and now, <hi>O thou Jew,</hi> is <hi>God</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jews only,</hi> is he not the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo; Yes, he is the God of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, ſeeing it is one <hi>God,</hi> which ſhall <hi>juſtifie</hi> the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>uncircumciſion</hi> through <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>this,</hi> or the like opportunity <hi>he</hi> takes often to <hi>declare</hi> the <hi>good will</hi> and favour of God towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> counted the <hi>Gentiles</hi> but as <hi>brute Beaſts,</hi> to whom <hi>God</hi> had no reſpect in compariſon of <hi>themſelves.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham believed God]</hi> We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 15, 5. That God brought <hi>Abraham</hi> forth abroad, and ſaid, <hi>Look now toward Heaven and tell the Stars, if thou art able to number them: And he ſaid to him, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi> Then followeth that which is here quoted by the Apoſtle, viz. <hi>He believed in, the Lord, and he counted it to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> That therefore for which <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>juſtified</hi> of God here, was this, and this only, that <hi>Abraham believed God, when he promiſed him that his Seed ſhould be as the Stars of heaven for multitude.</hi> See more of this <hi>v.</hi> 18. of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was counted unto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs] i. e.</hi> And it was <hi>accounted</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> (to wit, by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6.) at ſuch a <hi>rate,</hi> as that God did <hi>ſet down</hi> upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would <hi>repay,</hi> or <hi>requite</hi> him, for that his <hi>belief</hi> only, with <hi>juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning of this whole verſe is this, That <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe God, and God did ſo value and reſpect this, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe him, as that he was <hi>pleaſed</hi> in his Grace, and Favour, to recompence this <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> (though it were but for this) with <hi>juſtification;</hi> that is, to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Abraham,</hi> from all his ſins, and to deal with him as with a juſt man, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tranſgreſſed the Law in any point, only becauſe he had thus <hi>believed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, if God did <hi>juſtifie</hi> Abraham <hi>only for this,</hi> that he did <hi>thus believe him, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had not whereof to <hi>glory</hi> before God in matter of juſtification: For he could not claim <hi>juſtification</hi> by <hi>debt;</hi> and he which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59465:63"/> cannot claim juſtification of <hi>debt,</hi> but hath it of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> he cannot <hi>glory</hi> of his juſtification <hi>before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> requireth <hi>exact</hi> obedience, whether it be the Law of Nature, or the written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that he is <hi>curſed</hi> which continueth not in all things which the Law commandeth, and therefore he which hath broken the <hi>Law,</hi> in the leaſt <hi>tittle</hi> thereof, is <hi>curſed,</hi> and being now <hi>curſed,</hi> he cannot be juſtified, but by <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> If God therefore accept of our <hi>faith,</hi> for, or, to <hi>juſtification,</hi> ſo that he juſtifieth us, becauſe we <hi>believe,</hi> it is the <hi>meer Grace</hi> and Favour of God, and of ſuch juſtification we cannot <hi>glory,</hi> as we might do (in our Apoſtles ſence) if we had ſo <hi>kept</hi> the Law, as that we had never broke the <hi>leaſt Apex</hi> of it.</p>

               <p>Note, that the Hebrew Text, which our Apoſtle relates to <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. being tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word for word, is thus; <hi>And he believed in the Lord, and he</hi> (to wit, the Lord) <hi>counted it to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> But our Apoſtle followed the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which was then commonly received among the Jews, which ſpeaks thus; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Man</hi> calls only things which <hi>are,</hi> as a Maſter his Servant to come to him: But <hi>God</hi> calls even things <hi>which are not,</hi> and they come at his call.</p>
               <p>Note, that ſome underſtand theſe words, <hi>That quickneth the dead, and calleth the things which are not, as thoſe that be,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>carnal</hi> ſeed, or to the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the following part of this chapter: And then theſe words muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Gods <hi>enabling</hi> Abraham <hi>to beget,</hi> and Sarah <hi>to conceive,</hi> when in reſpect of <hi>Generation, Abraham;</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>Conception</hi> Sarah were now <hi>as dead,</hi> being that they were both decreped, and unfit by nature, the one to <hi>beget,</hi> the other to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> and <hi>bear Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Dead</hi> in this Sence, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch as are <hi>unfit for Generation</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi> by a Metaphor: And <hi>by making ſuch alive,</hi> is meant <hi>giving power to ſuch to beget, and conceive with child reſpectively,</hi> by the like Metaphor: And by things <hi>which are not,</hi> are meant (not things which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely without a being, but) things which are <hi>without a certain kind of being,</hi> as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> without the <hi>natural power of begetting,</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> without the <hi>natural power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> ſeed.</p>
               <p>But others underſtand theſe words, <hi>That quickneth the dead and calleth the things which be not as thoſe that be;</hi> as ſpoken in relation to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſuch as be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children by <hi>faith;</hi> And then the meaning of this <hi>which quickneth the dead</hi> is this, which <hi>quickneth</hi> thoſe which were <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> by bringing them to a <hi>lively faith.</hi> See for this <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. And the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>And call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe things which be not, as thoſe that be,</hi> is this, and making thoſe <hi>believe,</hi> which did <hi>not believe</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Now if it be asked, which of theſe <hi>two</hi> ſences are to be preferred before <hi>which;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Later,</hi> before the former; The ſence, which interprets theſe words of the <hi>Spiritual ſeed,</hi> before the ſenſe which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets thoſe words of the <hi>Carnal ſeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whereas the Apoſtle ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> That he <hi>is the Father of us all before
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59465:67"/> him whom he believed even God,</hi> ſignifying thereby, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the <hi>Spiritual Father of us All,</hi> not in <hi>word,</hi> but in <hi>deed;</hi> not in the <hi>opinion of Men,</hi> but in <hi>the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Approbation and Conſtitution of God;</hi> He goes on to to prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>ſuch a Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe to <hi>the being of ſuch a Father</hi> two things are requiſite: <hi>Firſt</hi> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhould be himſelf a man of a ſound and a ſtrong <hi>faith: Secondly,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>other</hi> men <hi>like</hi> him in his <hi>faith:</hi> He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both theſe in this latter part of the Chapter; For he ſheweth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>ſtrong in faith, verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ſhews, That God raiſeth up daily <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> men, out of ſuch as were not ſo, in the words which we have in hand.</p>
               <p>V. 18. <hi>Who againſt hope believed in hope]</hi> This is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he made mention of <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>It is a great <hi>Trajection</hi> or <hi>Hyperbaton</hi> to refer this to the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> verſe; I conceive it therefore not amiſs for the better <hi>Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of the Text, to underſtand here <hi>theſe</hi> or <hi>the like</hi> words, between <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> verſe, <hi>viz.

               <p>Again, he deſcribeth God by this, <hi>That he raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead,</hi> in this place; becauſe he would <hi>allude</hi> to that which <hi>Abraham believed</hi> here, who though he ſaw both his own Body now dead, and the deadneſs of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb, <hi>v.</hi> 19. yet he <hi>believed</hi> that God <hi>could raiſe</hi> them both, from that death or deadneſs.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle had rather ſay, <hi>who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi> to wit, <hi>to death,</hi> than <hi>who dyed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Expiation</hi> of our ſins, did depend upon the <hi>good pleaſure</hi> of God, who would <hi>this way</hi> be appeaſed for the <hi>ſins</hi> of Man.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle therefore expreſſeth <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> thing here, by <hi>two</hi> ſeveral phraſes; the like to which he did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt dyed</hi> that he might, as a <hi>Surety</hi> for us, pay the <hi>debt</hi> which was due from us for our ſins, to wit, <hi>death,</hi> and ſo <hi>deliver</hi> us from thoſe our <hi>ſins;</hi> hence Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>redeem us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.13. But yet the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, and his undergoing the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law for us, would have availed us nothing, if that Chriſt had <hi>alwayes lyen under death</hi> and <hi>alwayes</hi> lyen under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, as being <hi>overcome</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and kept <hi>Captive</hi> thereby: For to be <hi>detained alwayes</hi> a Priſoner in that Priſon, from whence there is no coming forth, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the payment of the uttermoſt farthing, Mat.</hi> 5.26. is to be <hi>always under execution,</hi> and to <hi>evacuate</hi> and <hi>null</hi> the Plea of the full payment of our <hi>debt,</hi> for which our <hi>Surety</hi> ſtood engaged for us.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> (that he might <hi>redeem us fully</hi> and pay our <hi>full debt</hi>) ſhould not only <hi>dye</hi> for us, but alſo <hi>riſe</hi> again, and upon <hi>this ground</hi> doth our Apoſtle rightly conclude; that <hi>if Chriſt be not raiſed, our faith is vain, we are yet in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59465:71"/> our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. And hence it is, that he ſaith, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.34. It <hi>is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not <hi>only</hi> for this <hi>reaſon</hi> may <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſaid to <hi>riſe again for our juſtification,</hi> but alſo for that, <hi>That he when he aroſe from the dead, he aroſe that he might aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there to appear in the preſence of God for us, Heb.</hi> 9.24 Where he is at the right hand of God, and <hi>maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.38.</p>

But to this I anſwer, That being that at that time there was no law publickly given by word of mouth (as that was, which was given to <hi>Adam</hi>) or given in outward writing (as that was, which was afterwards given by <hi>Moſes</hi>) there was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any Tranſgreſſion in that time; but yet it doth not follow, that though there was no Tranſgreſſion in that time, there was no ſin, for though every Tranſgreſſion be a ſin, yet it doth not follow that every ſin is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. I ſay therefore, that though there was no Law given by word of mouth or by writing, from <hi>Adam,</hi> until the law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet ſin was all the while in the world, though indeed ſin was not imputed to any, as a Tranſgreſſion all that time.</p>

And therefore was he a Figure of Chriſt, becauſe as Chriſt derived ſomething to his children, ſo did <hi>Adam,</hi> before Chriſt came, derive ſomething to his; But yet if we come to particulars, that which Chriſt derived to his children, was Grace, and the free gift of God; But that which <hi>Adam</hi> derived to his, was Original ſin, which I call here the Offence.</p>

               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Who is the figure of him that is to come] i. e.</hi> Who is the <hi>figure</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> who though he be <hi>now come</hi> into the world, yet was he <hi>not come</hi> then, but <hi>to come</hi> when death <hi>reigned</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam was</hi> a <hi>Figure or type of Chriſt</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a <hi>generall</hi> manner, to wit, becauſe as <hi>Adam conveyed</hi> or <hi>derived</hi> ſomething to <hi>his</hi> children, or to <hi>his</hi> branches, ſo did <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>his.</hi> But if we deſcend to <hi>particulars, Adam</hi> could not be the <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of Chriſt, but by a <hi>contrary</hi> compariſon: For <hi>Adam</hi> conveyed and derived <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death</hi> to <hi>his</hi> children, or to <hi>his</hi> branches; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> conveyed or derived <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, <hi>the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin</hi> (whereby they are juſtified) and <hi>life,</hi> to <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift] q. d</hi> But yet the <hi>free gift (ſupple)</hi> which cometh <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> upon <hi>his</hi> branches, or upon <hi>his</hi> children; <hi>Is not ſo (ſupple)</hi> for <hi>equality</hi> as the <hi>offence</hi> is <hi>(ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi> which cometh by <hi>Adam</hi> upon his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or upon <hi>his</hi> children, but <hi>much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it.</hi> Or thus: But yet not <hi>ſo mean</hi> as the <hi>offence</hi> is, which cometh by <hi>Adam</hi> upon <hi>his</hi> branches, or upon <hi>his</hi> children <hi>in its kind;</hi> is the <hi>free gift,</hi> which cometh by <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon <hi>his</hi> branches, or upon <hi>his</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>in its kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſheweth here that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>his</hi> kind, as he was a <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>his</hi> bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or to <hi>his</hi> children, did <hi>far exceed</hi> Adam <hi>in his kind,</hi> as he was a <hi>deſtroyer</hi> to <hi>his</hi> bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or to <hi>his</hi> children; And that he did confer <hi>more good</hi> to them, which were <hi>his</hi> branches, or <hi>his</hi> children; than <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>evil</hi> to thoſe, which were <hi>his,</hi> ſo that though <hi>Adam</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>a type of Chriſt by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compariſon,</hi> yet in that compariſon, there is an <hi>exceſs</hi> of contrariety on <hi>Chriſts part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not as the offence]</hi> He ſpeaks of <hi>that ſin,</hi> and means <hi>that</hi> here (even <hi>Original ſin</hi>) which <hi>Adam</hi> tranſmitted or derived to <hi>all mankind,</hi> and which he called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. He means not that <hi>ſin of actual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> whereby <hi>Adam diſobeyed</hi> God in <hi>eating the forbidden fruit,</hi> Gen. 3 6. Though that <hi>actuall diſobedience</hi> of his was <hi>that,</hi> which brought this <hi>Original ſin</hi> upon <hi>his</hi> poſterity, to wit, ſuch as were born of him, by <hi>natural</hi> generation.</p>
               <p>For note, that that <hi>Actual diſobedience</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>actual obedience of Chriſt,</hi> as plainly appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. But the <hi>offence</hi> here, is oppoſed to the <hi>free gift</hi> which <hi>came</hi> upon the Children or branches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> through <hi>his obedience.</hi> Wherefore as the <hi>free gift</hi> ſignifieth ſomething here, which <hi>came</hi> upon the children or branches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Chriſts obedience?</hi> ſo doth <hi>the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> (which is <hi>oppoſed</hi> to <hi>the free gift</hi>) ſignifie ſomething here, which <hi>came</hi> upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or branches of <hi>Adam,</hi> through his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The free gift] The free gift here ſpoken of,</hi> is that <hi>gift,</hi> which God doth freely beſtow upon thoſe, which are ingrafted into Chriſt by faith, and which he cals <hi>the gift by grace,</hi> in this very verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If through the offence of one] i. e.</hi> If by <hi>ſin,</hi> which was <hi>cauſed</hi> by one man, to wit,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59465:78"/> 
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> and by him brought upon or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his children or his branches. <hi>This Genitive caſe of one,</hi> is <hi>Genitivus Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note. that this particle, <hi>If,</hi> doth not here intimate any <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the thing with which it is joyned: But as often elſewhere ſo here, it ſheweth the <hi>certainty</hi> of it rather, and ſignifieth, as much as <hi>though.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And note, that the <hi>Subject</hi> of the <hi>offence</hi> here ſpoken of, is <hi>not Adam</hi> or <hi>Adam alone,</hi> but <hi>Adams children alſo,</hi> though the <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> (or deficient) cauſe thereof, was <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many be dead]</hi> This is that which he ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to wit, <hi>Death paſſed upon all men,</hi> that is, <hi>Death</hi> hath or ſhall paſs upon all men.</p>
               <p>But how doth he ſay only <hi>Many be dead here,</hi> when he ſaith <hi>Death paſſed upon all men ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>We may anſwer with <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> that it may ſo fall out ſometimes, as that by <hi>all,</hi> a <hi>very few</hi> may be be underſtood, as when <hi>few</hi> are <hi>all.</hi> To ſhew therefore that the <hi>(All)</hi> here, are <hi>very many:</hi> He ſaith <hi>Many be dead,</hi> yet excluding <hi>none of all the Sons or Daughters of Adam,</hi> born of him by <hi>natural</hi> generation.</p>
               <p>Again, becauſe he was to ſay in this verſe, that <hi>the grace of God and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto many</hi> (which he will ſay, becauſe it aboundeth <hi>not abſolutely to all men</hi>) he might uſe the word <hi>many</hi> here in the ſence aforeſaid, that there might be <hi>conformity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>former</hi> and <hi>latter</hi> member of his ſpeech, in matter of <hi>words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much more the grace of God, and the gifts by grace, which is by one Man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many] i. e.</hi> In a much <hi>higher</hi> degree and more <hi>plentiful</hi> (though <hi>contrary</hi>) manner, hath the <hi>grace,</hi> that is, <hi>the gift of grace,</hi> which is by one man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> abounded unto many <hi>(Supple)</hi> that they may <hi>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, that the words <hi>much more,</hi> ſeem to import an Argumentation <hi>à minori</hi> as Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſpeak, that is from that which <hi>is leſs credible,</hi> to that which is <hi>more credible,</hi> as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 9. But though they may <hi>ſeem</hi> ſo to do, yet they <hi>do not</hi> indeed. For he that will be attentive here to what the Apoſtle writes, he ſhall find, that the Apoſtles words import <hi>not</hi> any ſuch thing; but do onely ſhew <hi>the diſſimilitude,</hi> which is between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (by comparing ſome particulars, in which they <hi>diſagree</hi>) and how much <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his kind <hi>excells Adam</hi> in his.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>his kind</hi> excells <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>his,</hi> and why <hi>Chriſt</hi> derives <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> gifts in <hi>his</hi> kind, to <hi>his</hi> branches, or <hi>his</hi> children than <hi>Adam</hi> did in <hi>his</hi> kind, to <hi>his</hi> branches or <hi>his</hi> children, is, becauſe the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are greater, than were the <hi>demerits</hi> of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The grace of God]</hi> By the <hi>Grace of God</hi> is meant the <hi>favour of God:</hi> But the <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>favour</hi> of God is to be taken here by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy for the gift</hi> proceeding from Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as the Apoſtle expounds himſelf in the next words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the gift by Grace] q. d.</hi> That is to ſay, the gift which is by grace, or by the favour of God; or that, which God out of his grace and favour beſtoweth, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>The Conjunction And</hi> is a Note of <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The gift by Grace</hi> doth include and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend here, both the <hi>free and gracious pardon of our ſins,</hi> or the gracious ſentence of <hi>Abſolution,</hi> by which we are <hi>abſolved</hi> from our ſins, (which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) And alſo <hi>the gift of a life of Glory,</hi> which we ſhall enjoy in heaven, or the <hi>reign</hi> in that life (of which he ſpeaks, verſe 17.) For what he ſpeaks of in <hi>groſs</hi> here, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides and ſpeaks of in <hi>particular,</hi> or in <hi>parts</hi> in thoſe two verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt] i. e.</hi> Which grace is ſhewed for one mans ſake (to wit) Jeſus Chriſt, and purchaſed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath abounded] Supple,</hi> above what the <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>death</hi> did abound to thoſe, which were the branches or Children of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural propagation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto many] Supple,</hi> Even thoſe <hi>many</hi> which are the <hi>Branches</hi> or <hi>Children of Chriſt</hi> by faith.</p>
               <p>Through <hi>Adams eating</hi> the forbidden fruit, did the <hi>offence,</hi> that is, <hi>ſin</hi> enter upon many, yea, ſo many as were <hi>born</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Conſequent</hi> of which <hi>offence</hi> or <hi>ſin,</hi> as the penalty thereof, was <hi>death:</hi> But through the <hi>obedience of Chriſt,</hi> there came (by the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God) pardon of <hi>all</hi> ſins, not <hi>Original</hi> only, but <hi>Actual</hi> alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as many as believed, were juſtified, the <hi>Conſequent</hi> of which is, through the gift of God, Eternal <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is therefore an <hi>oppoſition</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> of ſins, by which we are juſtified, to <hi>the offence</hi> or <hi>ſin,</hi> by which we are condemned: And

               </p>
               <p>This is that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>groſs</hi> in this verſe, and now goeth about to <hi>divide,</hi> and lay out in <hi>particulars</hi> in the two following verſes.</p>

The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſheweth here the <hi>deteſtation</hi> even of ſuch a thought, as this is, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might <hi>continue in Sin, that the grace of God might abound;</hi> and that it is againſt the very <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>

               <p>Note, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks here of ſuch who had lived <hi>in Sin</hi> before their <hi>converſion</hi> to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That grace may abound]</hi> That is, that the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God may abound in <hi>pardoning</hi> our Sins, or that <hi>God</hi> may have the <hi>more abundant</hi> occaſion, to ſhew his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> to ſinners.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhall we that are dead unto Sin, live any longer therein?]</hi> The Apoſtle calls thoſe <hi>dead to Sin,</hi> which are <hi>dead in reſpect of Sin:</hi> That is, which have <hi>renounced,</hi> and caſt off the <hi>Service</hi> of ſin, and the <hi>obedience,</hi> which they were wont to yield to her; and as the <hi>dead</hi> have no <hi>commerce</hi> with the living, have no <hi>commerce</hi> with <hi>Sin,</hi> as they were wont to have. Or rather, as <hi>Servants,</hi> which are now dead are <hi>freed</hi> from their Maſters by <hi>death;</hi> ſo that their Maſters have no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> over them, neither do they <hi>ſerve them:</hi> So are they; which are <hi>dead to Sin,</hi> ſo <hi>freed</hi> from ſin, as that ſhe hath no power to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> them, nor do they <hi>obey,</hi> or <hi>ſerve</hi> her.</p>
               <p>All which profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are <hi>dead to Sin</hi> by <hi>profeſſion</hi> and by <hi>promiſe,</hi> for in their very <hi>entrance</hi> and admiſſion into the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> they <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſs</hi> that they will renounce <hi>ſin</hi> with her <hi>luſts.</hi> And they which are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well in <hi>truth</hi> as in <hi>profeſſion</hi> are <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> not in <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> only: But in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> too; for they are ſo <hi>mortified to ſin,</hi> as that they <hi>obey</hi> her not, neither have they their wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>commerce</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>If therefore we be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> if it be but by <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> only, how can we with <hi>any face</hi> live any longer to <hi>ſin?</hi> or in the <hi>obedience</hi> and ſervice of <hi>ſin?</hi> But if we are <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> not only <hi>in promiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> but alſo <hi>in truth</hi> and in <hi>reality too;</hi> how can we <hi>poſſibly</hi> live to ſin, or in the ſervice and <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> while we are <hi>dead to her?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus are <hi>Chriſtians, two</hi> manner of ways ſaid to be <hi>dead to ſin; Firſt</hi> by <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſſion: Secondly,</hi> in <hi>truth</hi> and in <hi>reality.</hi> And being any of theſe wayes <hi>dead</hi> to ſin, they cannot <hi>live</hi> any longer therein, For if they be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> but in <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> only, they cannot (to wit) with <hi>any face</hi> live to <hi>ſin.</hi> For who can (with any face) live to that which he hath <hi>promiſed,</hi> and <hi>profeſſed</hi> he hath nothing <hi>to do</hi> with, and which he hath <hi>renounced.</hi> And if they be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> not in <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> only, but in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> alſo: How can they <hi>poſſibly</hi> live to ſin? For it implieth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really dead,</hi> and yet to <hi>live</hi> to the ſame thing, to wit, at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> theſe <hi>two</hi> manner of wayes, I conceive that the Apoſtle argues here, in <hi>this</hi> part of the Chapter, from both theſe <hi>wayes,</hi> that is, from the <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which they make in their entrance, and admiſſion into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they <hi>renounce</hi> ſin, and will <hi>die</hi> unto it, (which he proſecutes in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> verſes,) And from that, that (if they be <hi>true Chriſtians</hi>) they are <hi>dead to ſin</hi> in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality,</hi> (which he proſecutes in the verſes following.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We that are dead to ſin]</hi> We may take notice here of the <hi>difference</hi> of theſe two <hi>Phraſes</hi> (to wit) <hi>to be dead to ſin,</hi> which is

                  <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſm into death]</hi> This is that which he ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>We were baptized into his death.</hi> Which words he <hi>repeateth</hi> or aſſumeth again here to ſet forth the <hi>end</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>But note, that whereas he ſaid onely, <hi>We were baptized into his death</hi> in the third verſe, here he ſaith, <hi>We are</hi> (or were <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) buried with him by Baptiſm to death,</hi> where he <hi>expreſſeth</hi> our being <hi>baptized</hi> with the <hi>Ceremony</hi> which was then uſed in <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> which was ſuch as that the parties <hi>baptized</hi> were <hi>dipped</hi> over head and ears and ſo <hi>buried</hi> as it were in the water as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>buried</hi> in the bowels of the earth. So that theſe words <hi>We are</hi> (or <hi>were buried with him by baptiſm into death</hi>) do ſpeak <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely</hi> and at large, what he ſaid in <hi>fewer</hi> words when he ſaid, <hi>We were baptized into his death.</hi> And what he ſaid <hi>implicitely</hi> and in fewer words when he ſaid, <hi>(We were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into his death)</hi> He ſaith more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely and at large, when he ſaith, <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſm into death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſm into death] i. e.</hi> We are or were baptized, into the ſimilitude of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buried with him by Baptiſm] i. e. Buried</hi> in the waters by being <hi>dipped</hi> over head and ears therein at our baptiſm, as he was <hi>buried</hi> in the bowels of the earth: and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence <hi>baptized</hi> into the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and repreſenting his <hi>death,</hi> at or in our <hi>baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (as I ſaid) expreſſeth here <hi>being baptized,</hi> by being <hi>buried by baptiſm</hi> which was a <hi>Ceremony</hi> uſed in thoſe days in <hi>baptiſm.</hi> For whereas we <hi>ſprinkle</hi> or <hi>pour water</hi> upon thoſe which we baptize, they of old <hi>dipped</hi> them over head and ears, and ſo <hi>buried</hi> them as it were in the waters, whom they <hi>baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> may ſeem thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their being <hi>baptized,</hi> and to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> here, becauſe it did more plainly <hi>repreſent</hi> the <hi>burial,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (to which this <hi>Ceremony</hi> doth allude) and by conſequence the <hi>death of Chriſt</hi> to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life which he lived before his Paſſion; and ſo by conſequence <hi>our death to ſin,</hi> which they which were baptized did <hi>profeſs</hi> by <hi>ſubmitting</hi> themſelves to that <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> themſelves to be <hi>dipped</hi> over head and ears in the waters, at their <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, here that <hi>thoſe</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſpeaks of, were <hi>men of ripe years</hi> and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> and ſuch, when they were <hi>baptized,</hi> were wont, for the moſt part, to be <hi>dipped</hi> over head and ears and <hi>buried</hi> as it were in the waters, when they were <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>dipping</hi> over head and ears, and <hi>burying</hi> as it were in the waters, was not <hi>eſſential</hi> to baptiſm. For the <hi>uſe of water</hi> in baptiſm, is and was to ſignifie <hi>outwardly,</hi> the <hi>inward cleanſing</hi> of the ſoul from ſin, which water doth aſwell by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> as it doth by our being <hi>dipped</hi> and <hi>overwhelmed</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>And it is more than probable, that though they of the <hi>primitive times</hi> uſed to <hi>dip</hi> over head and ears in <hi>baptiſm,</hi> yet they uſed <hi>ſprinkling</hi> alſo (eſpecially when the parties to be <hi>baptized</hi> were either <hi>Infants</hi> or <hi>ſick</hi> or <hi>weak</hi> of body) For whereas we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. that <hi>in one day</hi> (and that not an whole day neither) <hi>three thouſand ſouls were baptized by the Apoſtles,</hi> and that at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where there was no <hi>great Rivers,</hi> fit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59465:84"/> for ſuch <hi>baptiſm</hi> or <hi>dipping:</hi> It is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they did it, or could do it, by <hi>dipping</hi> them every one, whom they did <hi>baptize,</hi> over head and ears, and <hi>burying</hi> them, as it were in the waters, in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a time; but that they did it by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>pouring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> upon them. And in the time of <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> (who was promoted to that his <hi>Biſhoprick Anno</hi> 250) that <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> was uſed as well as <hi>dipping</hi> in baptiſm, and that not as a <hi>new</hi> thing, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by his 76.

               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>burying,</hi> as it were, in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> was of <hi>ancient</hi> uſe and <hi>long</hi> continuance in the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, cannot be <hi>denyed,</hi> though now <hi>the pouring</hi> on of water, or <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> is in a manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>uſed:</hi> But when <hi>dipping</hi> and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rying,</hi> as it were in the water, was ſo <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> uſed, they which were <hi>baptized,</hi> were for the moſt part men of <hi>ſtronger</hi> years converted from other <hi>Religions</hi> to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> But when <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had extended it ſelf almoſt to <hi>all</hi> parts of the known earth; and few <hi>men of years</hi> were now bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (who could <hi>better</hi> endure <hi>dipping,</hi> than Children and Infants could.) And when <hi>moſt,</hi> that were now to be baptized, were <hi>Infants,</hi> to whoſe tender bodies <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> might be <hi>offenſive</hi> for their health; <hi>pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> on of water, or <hi>ſprinkling</hi> came to be in a manner altogether uſed in the place of <hi>dipping.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The power of God</hi> is called a <hi>glorious</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.11.

               </p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Hebraiſm</hi> in theſe words <hi>(viz) Newneſs of life,</hi> which are put for a <hi>new life,</hi> or a <hi>new kind of life.</hi>

               <p>Note, that this word <hi>walk,</hi> is frequently in Scripture taken, as a word of <hi>morality,</hi> by which is Metaphorically ſignified, <hi>the life</hi> and <hi>converſation of a Man,</hi> and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living; who <hi>practiſeth,</hi> or exerciſeth <hi>act</hi> after <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>deed</hi> after <hi>deed:</hi> taking thereby as it were <hi>ſtep</hi> after <hi>ſtep,</hi> one <hi>ſtep</hi> after another.

               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore, when he was <hi>laid in the Sepulchre,</hi> under the ground, was ſaid to be <hi>buried,</hi> ſo were they ſaid to be <hi>buried,</hi> who were in baptiſm ſo <hi>dipped,</hi> as that they were under the waters.</p>

               <p>If we ſhould look to the <hi>order</hi> or <hi>ſeries</hi> of ſpeech, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeech is ſomewhat <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous,</hi> for he ſhould rather have ſaid here, <hi>We are crucified to the old man,</hi> than have ſaid, <hi>Our old man is crucified.</hi> For he ſaid verſe 5. <hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death.</hi> And in the ſeventh verſe he ſaith: <hi>He that is dead is freed from ſin.</hi> And verſe 8. <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. to which theſe words ſhould be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And when he ſaith, that <hi>he that is dead is freed from ſin,</hi> he alludes to a <hi>Servant,</hi> or a <hi>Slave,</hi> which by his <hi>death</hi> is freed from the Law or bonds of his Maſter, ſo that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath now no <hi>power</hi> over him: For ſuch is the condition of the <hi>dead,</hi> as that they are <hi>civily</hi> ſubject to no <hi>humane</hi> power at all.</p>
               <p>Note here, that for <hi>a man to be dead to ſin</hi> is the ſame in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> phraſe, as <hi>for ſin, or the old man to be crucified in him.</hi> And the Apoſtle uſeth them <hi>promiſcuouſly.</hi>

               <p>But hitherto he hath declared only, that he knew, that they which were <hi>Planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt in the likeneſs of his death, that is, that they which were crucified, or dead to ſin with Chriſt, were therefore ſo plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſo dead, that they ſhould ſerve ſin no more.</hi> He hath not as yet declared, that he knew, that they which were ſo planted, and ſo dead <hi>ſhould riſe or ſpring up to a new life:</hi> for it is <hi>not</hi> enough to ſhew, that a man <hi>doth good,</hi> to ſhew, that he <hi>abſtains from evil.</hi>

               <p>Note, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> directs this his ſpeech <hi>to the believing Jews,</hi> in a particular manner.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that by the <hi>Law,</hi> is here meant the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> as it was <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as it is in it ſelf <hi>preciſely</hi> conſidered; in which regard it had but <hi>little</hi> power to keep a ſinner from <hi>yielding</hi> to the motions of ſin. And indeed when the word <hi>Law</hi> is put <hi>abſolutely</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>grace,</hi> it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>ſo</hi> ſignifieth. So that the ſence of theſe words may be this <hi>q. d.</hi> For ye are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law,</hi> which had <hi>not power enough</hi> to keep you <hi>from</hi> the dominion of ſin: But ye are under <hi>grace,</hi> which giveth you <hi>ſtrength</hi> to free your ſelves from ſin, that ſhe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer not over you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye are not under the Law] To be under the Law</hi> ſignifieth <hi>two</hi> things, to wit, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>the obligation of the Law:</hi> And to be under the <hi>imperfection of the Law;</hi> that is, to be under the <hi>Law</hi> as it was <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and as it is <hi>preciſely</hi> conſidered without the <hi>grace</hi> of the Goſpel; In which <hi>laſt</hi> ſence the <hi>Law</hi> though it did <hi>impoſe</hi> commands upon men, it did not either of it ſelf or by any thing joyned with it, <hi>afford ſtrength</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to a ſinner to <hi>reſiſt</hi> ſin, and to <hi>perform</hi> thoſe her commands. For <hi>the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 1.17.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>to be under the Law,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>here,</hi> not only to be under the <hi>obligation of the Law,</hi> ſo that a man is bound to do what the Law requires; But alſo and that eſpecially, to be <hi>under the imperfection of the Law,</hi> as it commandeth men to do theſe and theſe things, but doth not <hi>help</hi> them as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth, to <hi>perform</hi> thoſe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>not</hi> to be doubted, but that in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> there were many <hi>Jews</hi> which were <hi>free</hi> from the dominion of ſin, through <hi>faith:</hi> Theſe though they were <hi>under the obligation of</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they were bound to do all the commands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet they were not under <hi>the imperfection of the Law;</hi> for through <hi>faith</hi> they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>ſtrength</hi> by Chriſt, to <hi>reſiſt</hi> ſin, which the <hi>Law</hi> could not afford: for <hi>Chriſt was the ſame yeſterday and to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.8. But now the <hi>believing</hi> Jews, are free not only from <hi>the imperfection,</hi> but alſo from <hi>the obligation of the Law of</hi> Moſes, to wit, <hi>as</hi> the Law was <hi>given</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law being quite <hi>abrogated,</hi> as it was <hi>by him</hi> given, So that they are not bound to keep the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as it was given <hi>by</hi> Moſes, but as it is the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have men obſerve by

               <p>
                  <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.16. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, that he ſhould ſay here, that <hi>ſin ſhall have no dominion ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Or thus, <hi>ye were free from Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, ye did not the <hi>works</hi> of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where to <hi>be free from Righteouſneſs,</hi> is put <hi>per Metonymiam cauſae,</hi> for <hi>not to do the works of Righteouſneſs.</hi> For a man that is <hi>free,</hi> will not ordinarily <hi>do</hi> the work of him, from whom he is <hi>free.</hi>

               <p>Know ye not therefore (Brethren) (for I ſpeak to you Jews, which know and are acquainted with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Old Teſtament) how that the Law, which was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath dominion over the man, which is under it, ſo that he cannot free himſelf from the obligation thereof, ſo long as it liveth; that is, ſo long, as it ſtandeth in force, and is not abrogated? Surely you do.</p>
               <p>For the caſe between them which were under the law, and the law it ſelf, is as the caſe, which is between a woman and her husband.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The woman which hath an husband is bound by the Law, to her husband, ſo long as he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] i. e</hi> The <hi>woman</hi> which hath an <hi>husband</hi> is ſo bound by the Law to her husband, as that ſhe cannot <hi>free</hi> herſelf from him and <hi>marry</hi> another man, but muſt perform the <hi>office of a wife</hi> to him, ſo long as he <hi>liveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law,</hi> which he here ſpeaks of, is in ſpecial, <hi>the Law of Matrimony,</hi> which we read of in the Old Teſtament and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. where it is written <hi>that a man ſhall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Which words ſhew the <hi>Indiſſolubility</hi> of Matromo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as our Saviour himſelf teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5.</p>
               <p>But it may be <hi>objected</hi> that by the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> a man might give his wife a <hi>Bill of divorcement</hi> and put her away, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. How then may one ſay, is the <hi>bond</hi> of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony <hi>in diſſoluble,</hi> or how then is the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> which hath an husband, <hi>bound</hi> to her husband ſo long <hi>as he liveth.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>objection</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made in this matter to our <hi>Saviour:</hi> And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth it <hi>Matth</hi> 19.7, 8. The ſum of which anſwer is this, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> did concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Bill of divorce,</hi> he did rather by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> than <hi>approbation,</hi> and that by reaſon of the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of heart, which was in the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that <hi>notwithſtanding that,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Law</hi> of Marriage recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. ſtood in full force, and God would have it ſo to ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if her husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the law of her husband] i. e.</hi> But if her <hi>hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> be <hi>dead,</hi> ſhe is <hi>looſed</hi> from the power or <hi>dominion,</hi> which the <hi>husband</hi> hath over her by the <hi>Law of Marriage:</hi> or ſhe is <hi>looſed</hi> from that <hi>bond,</hi> by which ſhe was <hi>tyed</hi> to her husband, <hi>by that Law.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Law of the husband,</hi> is to be taken here (by a Metonymy) for <hi>the power and dominion, which a man hath over his wife by the Law of Marriage:</hi> Or it is taken for the <hi>bond by which a wife is bound to her husband by that Law.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>ordinary</hi> marriages, if the <hi>husband</hi> be dead, the <hi>wife</hi> is ſo at liberty, as that ſhe <hi>may</hi> marry again if ſhe will, or <hi>not</hi> marry if ſhe pleaſe; and if ſhe be pleaſed to <hi>marry,</hi> ſhe <hi>may</hi> marry, <hi>whom ſhe will:</hi> But in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between a <hi>man</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> if the <hi>Law be dead,</hi> the man is inded <hi>freed</hi> from the Law, but yet he is <hi>not left at liberty</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or not to marry, but he <hi>muſt</hi> marry: And yet, he <hi>muſt not</hi> marry whom he will, but he muſt marry <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo that in this <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude</hi> (as it is commonly) there is ſome <hi>diſſimilitude</hi> not to be urged.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The fruit or children here ſpoken of or meant,</hi> are <hi>evil works</hi> or <hi>actual Sins,</hi> which are therefore pleaſing unto <hi>death,</hi> and ſuch as death <hi>delights</hi> in, becauſe they <hi>make</hi> them which commit them, <hi>food</hi> for her.

               <p>Note, that the particle, <hi>To,</hi> ſignifieth here not the <hi>intent</hi> only, but the <hi>event</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>A queſtion may be here asked, why the Apoſtle did not ſay, <hi>to bring forth fruit unto the Law,</hi> as he ſaid, ver. 4. <hi>That we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> that is, <hi>to Christ,</hi> when as he is <hi>treating</hi> here of the <hi>oppoſition</hi> between the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Sins</hi> may not be ſaid to be the <hi>fruit of the Law,</hi> becauſe they are both <hi>forbidden</hi> and <hi>puniſhed</hi> by the <hi>law.</hi> But they may be ſaid to <hi>be the fruit of death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make men <hi>children of death,</hi> as the Hebrews ſpeak, that is, <hi>worthy of death.</hi> Thus ſome.</p>
               <p>But yet, I conceive (under correction) that by <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> may be here meant, which is called <hi>the miniſtration of death</hi> and <hi>the miniſtration of condemnation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. And therefore may be called <hi>death</hi> by a <hi>Metonymie.</hi> And it is <hi>no abſurdity</hi> to give the <hi>effects</hi> which are attributed <hi>to death,</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> when we give them and attribute them to the <hi>Law, not</hi> as to <hi>the cauſe</hi> but only as to the <hi>occaſion</hi> thereof. For it is written, <hi>ver.</hi> 10 <hi>And the Commandment which was ordained to life: I found to be unto death:</hi> And thus the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> here in hand, will well hold out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeemeth to mention <hi>this</hi> and to ſhew <hi>how it was</hi> with them while they were <hi>under the Law,</hi> in the <hi>fleſh:</hi> That <hi>now</hi> being they were <hi>delivered</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> and from the <hi>fleſh,</hi> they might be <hi>more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and more diligent to do thoſe things which were <hi>pleaſing to God</hi> in <hi>newneſs</hi> of Spirit, <hi>abandoning</hi> the <hi>oldneſs</hi> of the Letter.</p>
               <p>V. 6. <hi>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we held] i. e.</hi> But <hi>now</hi> (as the <hi>Wife</hi> is looſed from her <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> if he be dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) ſo are we (who were as a <hi>Wife</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi>) delivered from the <hi>law,</hi> which is or was our <hi>husband,</hi> by the <hi>death of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> is to be taken here as it was, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, viz. <hi>For the whole Law of Moſes as it was given by Moſes; and ſo preciſely given without the grace of the Goſpel:</hi> And in this ſence to <hi>be delivered from the Law</hi> and to be <hi>delivered from the fleſh</hi> will ſignifie both <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> thing.</p>

               <p>By <hi>the death of the Law</hi> he means <hi>the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or expiration thereof;</hi> but he ſpeaks of the <hi>Law</hi> as of an <hi>Husband</hi> by an <hi>Allegory,</hi> therefore ſaith rather, <hi>That being dead wherein we were held,</hi> than <hi>That being abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated or expired wherein we were held.</hi>

               <p>And being <hi>the Law</hi> was but a <hi>bare letter</hi> and did in a manner tell a man <hi>only</hi> what was good, and command him to do it, it did by <hi>Accident</hi> when he was <hi>bad</hi> make him <hi>worſe,</hi> for except a <hi>Carnal</hi> man, hath grace given him, to <hi>keep</hi> the commandments he <hi>runs contrary</hi> to the commandments, and grows the <hi>worſe</hi> by being commanded.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>not by ſpeaking</hi> to our ſpirit as it did to the <hi>ſpirit of the Prophets,</hi> when it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of the <hi>will of God:</hi> But by thoſe <hi>effects</hi> which it produceth in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> as <hi>ſanctification</hi> and a <hi>loving</hi> and truly <hi>filial</hi> affection towards God, <hi>flowing</hi> from thence, and the like, which the <hi>ſoul</hi> perceiving and taking notice of, from thence, <hi>concludes,</hi> and perſwades it ſelf, or us, <hi>that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi>

               <p>I have taken the word <hi>vanity,</hi> ver. 20. and the word <hi>Corruption</hi> ver. 21. hitherto for <hi>men, wicked men,</hi> or <hi>ſinners,</hi> as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done before me.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To Vanity</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> this way taken, was the Creature, eſpecially the <hi>Sublunary</hi> Creatures, (which we muſt now either ſolely or chiefly underſtand here by the Creatures) made ſubject, either <hi>wholly</hi> or in <hi>its</hi> parts, for the ſin of man; for as God curſed the earth for Mans ſake, when he had eaten of the forbidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. So no doubt did he the reſt of the <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Elementary</hi> compounds, by which they became more <hi>impure</hi> than they were before, and <hi>more</hi> ſubject to corruption, and were <hi>more</hi> often corrupted (and that in a baſer manner) than otherwiſe they would have been. I ſay, than <hi>otherwiſe</hi> they would have been; for though Man had never <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> yet there would have been a <hi>Corruption</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59465:109"/> of the Elements in their parts, being that there would have been a <hi>Generation</hi> of herbs and trees and other things.</p>

               <p>This is the meaning of the word <hi>Called,</hi> in this, and moſt other places of the New Teſtament: So that <hi>the word</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>bare calling,</hi> but ſuch an <hi>effectual</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby they <hi>that are called do obey,</hi> or accept of the <hi>call,</hi> and ſo believe.</p>

               <p>That there was an <hi>opinion</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> that it <hi>was enough for a Jew to be of the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he might be juſtified</hi> appears by what <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaid to thoſe which came to his Baptiſm; <hi>Think not to ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>for our father,</hi> Matth. 3.9 But ſee further, what I ſaid on thoſe words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou art called a Jew.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore for the <hi>greateſt part,</hi> did think to obtain <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>works,</hi> but ſome thought it enough for <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> or <hi>Jacobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring according to the <hi>fleſh,</hi> Or, if this was a <hi>General</hi> opinion among them (as ſome ſay it was) then the <hi>Jews</hi> thought, that they had <hi>two</hi> ſtrings to their bow, or, <hi>two</hi> titles to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was good, as the Apoſtle ſhews.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Note here, that the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> (which was a Land <hi>flowing with milk and honey,</hi> and into which <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun</hi> (a type of our <hi>Jeſus</hi>) brought the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>) was a <hi>type</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Graces</hi> and ſpiritual bleſſings, which we receive by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> did God promiſe to give to <hi>Abraham and to his ſeed,</hi> Gen. 12.7. and Gen. 13.15, And yet not to him and to all or any of his <hi>ſeed;</hi> but only to <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Son Iſaac,</hi> and to thoſe, which ſhould come of <hi>him,</hi> for when <hi>Sarah</hi> cried out to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Hagar,</hi> and her Son <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> which ſhe had by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Caſt out the Bond woman and her Son for the ſon of the Bond woman, ſhall not be heir with my ſon, even with</hi> Iſaac.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59465:119"/> Hagar, but in all that</hi> Sarah <hi>hath ſaid unto thee, hearken unto her voice; For in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed,</hi> (to wit, <hi>that ſeed which ſhall inherit the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee) be called,</hi> Gen. 21. ver. 10, 11, 12.

               <p>Now as the <hi>promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>ſeed</hi> appertained not to all the <hi>ſons of Abraham</hi> (though they were his <hi>ſons</hi> or <hi>children</hi> by <hi>carnal generation</hi> and came out of his Loins) but only to <hi>Iſaac:</hi> So do the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual bleſsings,</hi> (As of <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>remiſsion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. which were <hi>typified by the Land of Canaan</hi>) which were made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his ſeed, appertain, not to thoſe which were <hi>typified by Iſhmael,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> to <hi>thoſe</hi> which were <hi>typified</hi> by his ſon <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and <hi>who</hi> thoſe were the Apoſtle <hi>opens,</hi> in the next verſe following.</p>
               <p>The land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was (as I ſaid) A <hi>type</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the Spiritual bleſſings which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> as <hi>juſtification,</hi> and <hi>glorification,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>

               <p>That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſaith therefore is this, that <hi>when</hi> Rebecca <hi>had conceived by her husband, between that time and the birth of the children which ſhe had conceived,</hi> that is, when the children

               <p>A Queſtion may here be asked, <hi>viz.</hi> How S. <hi>Paul</hi> can draw an Argument from this, <hi>That it was ſaid to</hi> Rebecca <hi>(while her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were yet in her womb, before they had done any good or evil) the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, to prove that the purpoſe of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Election,</hi> was and ſhould immutably be, without <hi>conſideration,</hi> or <hi>regard</hi> of the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Elected;</hi> For though a man <hi>cannot work</hi> before he is <hi>born,</hi> yet might <hi>God foreſee</hi> what works he would do after he was <hi>born,</hi> and deal with him in his <hi>Election,</hi> accordingly.</p>
               <p>I anſw. That if S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have gone about to draw an <hi>Argument</hi> from hence <hi>Ex natura rei</hi> or <hi>ex vi terminorum,</hi> or by neceſſary conſequence to ſhew that the <hi>Election</hi> of God was not of <hi>works,</hi> or for <hi>works;</hi> becauſe it was <hi>ſaid to</hi> Rebecca,

                  <hi>while her two children were in her womb, the Elder, ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would not have been <hi>ſolide;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God might <hi>foreſee</hi> what workes a man would do after his <hi>birth,</hi> even <hi>before</hi> he was <hi>born.</hi> But it was not the Apoſtles <hi>intent</hi> to draw <hi>ſuch</hi> an argument from hence, but onely to uſe <hi>argumentum a typo,</hi> or <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum a ſigno,</hi> which conſiſteth only in the <hi>ſetting out,</hi> or <hi>declaring</hi> of Gods <hi>intent, Viz. That intent,</hi> which he had in <hi>giving</hi> that Anſwer to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> to wit, that <hi>the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger</hi> before the children <hi>were born;</hi> whoſe <hi>intent</hi> was, to <hi>ſignifie,</hi> or typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thereby, that <hi>his purpoſe concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of man to juſtification, was, and ſhould ſo remain to be to elect, not for mans work ſake, but for his own good will and pleaſures ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas we ſaid that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meaneth here, by <hi>Election, Election to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and whereas, where he ſpeaks of <hi>Juſtificati n,</hi> he ſaith every where, that <hi>that is</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> not of <hi>works:</hi> it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that by <hi>Election</hi> the Apoſtle cannot mean here, <hi>Election to juſtification,</hi> becauſe he never <hi>excludes faith,</hi> when he ſpeaks of juſtification, but <hi>includes</hi> it, and aſſerts it rather: <hi>But</hi> here, when it is ſaid, that <hi>the Children being not yet born, not having done any good or evil, it was ſaid the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger.

Surely no, and what is the reaſon? Not becauſe all things <hi>wanted aptitude</hi> to typifie or ſignifie which were not <hi>actual ſigns</hi> or <hi>types;</hi> but becauſe they were not <hi>actually applyed</hi> thereunto: Now this that God ſaid to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger before the Children were yet born, and before they had done any good or evil,</hi> hath indeed an <hi>aptitude</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>excluſion</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> from the purpoſe of God concerning Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as <hi>of works;</hi> but yet becauſe they are <hi>not actually applyed</hi> by <hi>God</hi> ſo to do they may <hi>not do</hi> it, but exclude <hi>works on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and not <hi>faith.</hi>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59465:121"/> Eſau</hi> in his <hi>Poſterity</hi> ſhall ſerve <hi>Jacob</hi> in his.</p>
               <p>This which is here ſaid of the <hi>Elder</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Younger</hi> is to be underſtood of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but not of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in their <hi>perſons,</hi> but in their <hi>poſterities:</hi> For if we conſider <hi>Jacob</hi> in his <hi>perſon, Jacob</hi> might be ſaid to <hi>ſerve Eſau</hi> rather, than <hi>Eſau Jacob,</hi> for he termed himſelf <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>ſervant, Gen.</hi> 32.18. And he <hi>called</hi> Eſau <hi>his Lord,</hi> Gen. 33. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. And he did him <hi>homage bowing himſelf down to the ground many times before him, Gen.</hi> 33.3. And where the words cited by the Apoſtle, are read <hi>Gen</hi> 25.23. It is plain, that they extend rather to the <hi>Nations,</hi> that ſhould come from <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> than that they are tyed up to <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>Though therefore <hi>Eſau</hi> in his <hi>perſon,</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not <hi>Jacob</hi> in his <hi>perſon,</hi> yet the <hi>poſterity of Eſau</hi> ſerved <hi>the Poſterity of Jacob</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> time, when the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> or <hi>Edomites,</hi> which were of the <hi>Poſterity of Eſau,</hi> were ſubdued by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which were the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of Jacob,</hi> and brought under their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> &amp; made ſervants to them 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>his poſterity;</hi> as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Iſaac</hi> according to the <hi>Fleſh</hi> (to <hi>whom</hi> the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was made <hi>as</hi> well as to <hi>Abraham</hi>) do ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie or typifie here <hi>the children of the fleſh</hi> as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did, in the <hi>Story</hi> before. And <hi>Jacob</hi> ſignifieth or typifieth the <hi>ſpiritual ſeed</hi> or the <hi>faithful,</hi> which were called the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Promiſe ver.</hi> 8. As did his Father <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> in the <hi>former ſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by <hi>Eſaus ſervitude</hi> is meant or typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>the continuing of ſuch as were typified by Eſau,</hi> that is, <hi>of the children according to the fleſh, under ſin, as under a Tyrant,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Lord,</hi> without deliverance from (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dominion, or) Guilt of it. And by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s being a <hi>Lord</hi> (and ſo <hi>free</hi>) is meant the <hi>freedom of thoſe from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin</hi> (and the dominion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) <hi>which</hi> were typified by <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, <hi>of the faithful,</hi> called the <hi>Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Note that <hi>Eſau</hi> may be taken here to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, <hi>a Child of the fleſh,</hi> becauſe he was the <hi>Elder brother:</hi> And men muſt have a being <hi>according to the Fleſh, before they</hi> can be children <hi>according to the Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they can believe, for Nature is before Grace, and <hi>Jacob</hi> may be taken to ſignifie <hi>a child according to the Spirit,</hi> that is, a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> becauſe he was the <hi>younger brother:</hi> For men come to be <hi>children according to the Spirit,</hi> that is, men come to <hi>believe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> they are children according to the <hi>fleſh:</hi> So that <hi>generally</hi> the <hi>children of the fleſh</hi> are <hi>elder</hi> than the <hi>children of the Promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>children of the Promiſe younger</hi> than the <hi>Children of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note again, that <hi>ſervitude</hi> under an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a Lord, a Maſter, or a tyrant, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken in Scripture, as a type of <hi>Captivity under ſin, and the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof:</hi> And that the <hi>freedom</hi> from ſuch an enemy Lord, Maſter, or Tyrant is frequently taken as a <hi>Type of deliverance from ſin,</hi> and that ſo frequently as that we need ſay no more of it.</p>
               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>As it is written Jacob have I loved but Eſau have I hated] i e.</hi> Which <hi>propheſie,</hi> or ſaying accords with that which is written by <hi>Malachy, Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Jacob have I loved, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau have I hated;</hi> At leaſt in a <hi>general</hi> way.</p>
               <p>That which the <hi>Prophet Malachy</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> did in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory concern only the <hi>bodily</hi> or <hi>wordly</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of thoſe two Brethren, or <hi>rather</hi> of their poſterity, reſpectively: but we muſt <hi>lift it up</hi> to the <hi>myſtical</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſence,</hi> wherein God ſheweth his love, to thoſe, which were <hi>typified by Jacob</hi> and his Sons in remitting their ſins, and juſtifying them from their offences: and <hi>his hatred</hi> in thoſe which are <hi>typified in Eſau</hi> and his Poſterity in letting them <hi>lie in the guilt of their ſins</hi> without remiſſion.</p>
               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is there unrighteouſneſs with God?]</hi> That is, what ſhall we <hi>infer,</hi> from what I have ſaid; ſhall we <hi>infer</hi> from what I have ſaid, <hi>that there is unrighteouſneſs with God,</hi> becauſe he <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by</hi> ſo many of the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which <hi>are fleſh</hi> of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> yea, <hi>though</hi> they ſought juſtification by <hi>their works:</hi> And <hi>pardoneth</hi> thoſe which are the <hi>Children of promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Children according to the Spirit,</hi> that is thoſe which believe, though they be <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not of the Stock of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, only</hi> becauſe they <hi>believe?</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle prevents</hi> an objection here, for whereas he concluded in his laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that <hi>they which are the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>or</hi> Iſaac, <hi>or</hi> Jacob <hi>according to the fleſh, theſe are not theſe children, which God promiſed to juſtifie;</hi> no, nor yet as they were <hi>under the Law</hi> and ſought <hi>juſtification by works;</hi> But the <hi>Children of the promiſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>faithfull</hi> (whether they be of the Stock of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59465:122"/> or whether they be of a Gentile race) theſe are <hi>the only</hi> children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which God made <hi>that spiritual promiſe of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and which he would juſtifie. A <hi>Jew</hi> might ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> if this be ſo, then by thy <hi>doctrine</hi> God <hi>rejecteth</hi> thoſe, which are of the <hi>holy ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> yea though they <hi>ſeek</hi> juſtification by <hi>the works</hi> of the Law, which God hath given them, <hi>if they do not believe;</hi> and <hi>juſtifieth not</hi> only thoſe, which are of the <hi>holy Stock</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if <hi>they believe,</hi> but alſo ſuch as are of the <hi>unclean Race</hi> of the Gentiles But if God ſhall <hi>do ſo</hi> indeed, as thou teacheſt by this thy doctrine, then would God be <hi>unjuſt;</hi> for it would be <hi>injuſtice</hi> or <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> in God, thus to reject the holy ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> only for <hi>not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and thus to <hi>accept</hi> of the <hi>unclean</hi> Race of the Gentiles, only becauſe <hi>they believe.</hi> This objection, I ſay, the Appoſtle prevents here, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we then ſay? is there unrighteouſneſs in God? God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?] i. e</hi> What ſhall we <hi>infer</hi> then, or what ſhall we <hi>gather</hi> then from that which I have ſaid?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there unrighteouſneſs with God?] i. e.</hi> Shall we <hi>infer</hi> from thence that God is <hi>unjust</hi> in theſe his dealings and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God forbid] i. e.</hi> No by no means, See <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>For he ſaith to Moſes I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, &amp;c.]</hi> He gives a <hi>reaſon</hi> here, why; God is <hi>not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt</hi> in paſſing by ſo many of the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> which were their children only according <hi>to the fleſh,</hi> and not juſtifying them, yea though they ſought Juſtification <hi>by their works,</hi> and in juſtifying all thoſe, which were the <hi>children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> or, children according <hi>to the Spirit,</hi> though they were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>deſcended not</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>lineal</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaith to Moſes]</hi> To wit, <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion]</hi> Theſe words were <hi>ſpoken</hi> by God <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. And they were <hi>ſpoken</hi> by occaſion of that, that the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> had in the abſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> made them a <hi>molten Calf,</hi> and worſhipped it ſaying <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which brought thee up, out of the land of</hi> Egypt. At which the <hi>Lord</hi> was exceeding <hi>angry,</hi> and would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>them all</hi> had not <hi>Moſes</hi> entreated the Lord earneſtly to <hi>pardon</hi> this their ſin, But the Lord would <hi>not pardon</hi> them all, but <hi>ſome</hi> only, ſaying, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By theſe words, God ſheweth, that he is, <hi>free and reſtrained by no Law</hi> from ſhewing mercy and exerciſing compaſſion, <hi>where he pleaſeth:</hi> And therefore he is not <hi>unjuſt or unrighteous</hi> in juſtifying thoſe, that are the children of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> yea though they be <hi>Gentiles,</hi> moſt of them.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>So then it is not of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, nor him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy]</hi> This <hi>concluſion</hi> doth moſt <hi>naturally</hi> ariſe out of what the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, but yet it is not <hi>that,</hi> which he was to prove (but that, which he was to prove, he inferrs from hence, and ſets down <hi>ver.</hi> 18) But it is a <hi>concluſion</hi> (as it ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>by the by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Queſtion</hi> therefore it is, and well <hi>may be,</hi> to what end, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes mention of this <hi>Concluſion</hi> and why he draws it out and alleadgeth it here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Concluſion</hi> is (as I ſaid) drawn <hi>by the by,</hi> out of the 15. verſe, and the Apoſtle <hi>often</hi> draws <hi>concluſions</hi> and <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> after this manner, as <hi>I</hi> have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>before. ver.</hi> 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.16: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then it is indeed, for the moſt part, for the <hi>proof</hi> of ſome ſubject, which he had treated of <hi>before:</hi> But he hath not as yet <hi>directly</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſuch a <hi>Subject</hi> as this <hi>concluſion</hi> is, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: To what <hi>end</hi> thererefore doth he draw this concluſion?</p>
               <p>To ſpeak therefore (under correction) what I conceive: The <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>grief</hi> and ſorrow, which the Apoſtle expreſſeth, (<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this <hi>chapter</hi>) was becauſe that the <hi>Jews being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs and going about to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and zealouſly and eagerly running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, had not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God, &amp;c.</hi> This was the true <hi>ground</hi> of this grief, which though he <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> not here, in this <hi>Chapter</hi> by reaſon of ſome <hi>Objections,</hi> which he was to <hi>prevent,</hi> yet he <hi>intimated</hi> it here, and <hi>expreſſeth</hi> it <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. This their <hi>errour</hi> and their <hi>zeal</hi> the Jews were ready to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>maintain,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as ready to <hi>confute</hi> having there ſuch an <hi>opportune occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to gather a <hi>concluſion</hi> or argument, in <hi>confutation</hi> of that their <hi>errour</hi> here, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it not (though he had their errour but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59465:122"/> little more than in his ſerious and grieved <hi>thoughts</hi> as yet, and <hi>expreſſed</hi> not ſo fully and plainly as he intended to do, and as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth, <hi>Chap</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.)

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>For the Scripture ſaith] i. e.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> ſaith in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> is put here for <hi>God ſpeaking in the Scripture,</hi> ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. we read that the <hi>Scripture hath concluded all under ſin;</hi> where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is put for <hi>God ſpeaking in the Scripture,</hi> per Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being at this time in <hi>Eygpt, Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>oppreſs</hi> them, in ſetting them to make bricks and putting cruel task-maſters over them, inſomuch that the children of <hi>Iſrael ſighed mightily and cried to the Lord</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that oppreſſion; whereupon the Lord made choice of <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſent <hi>him</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> in his name, to bid <hi>Pharaoh let his people go;</hi> but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hearkned not to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but deſpiſed the Lord, who ſent him, though <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed by many <hi>miracles</hi> that he came from <hi>God;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Lord</hi> bid <hi>Moſes</hi> tell <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> at length, of his ſtubborneſs, and that except he would let his people go to ſerve him, he would <hi>ſtretch</hi> out his hand to <hi>cut</hi> him off from the earth, and bid him <hi>tell</hi> him <hi>moreover</hi> that <hi>in very deed for this cauſe he had raiſed him up,</hi> or ſtirred him up; <hi>for to ſhew his power in him and that his name might be declared through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Earth.</hi>

               <p>They are ſuch as <hi>believed not</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when it was <hi>preached</hi> unto them, which the Apoſtle <hi>here aims</hi> at as appeareth by the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of his ſpeech, and among them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom God rejected from <hi>juſtification,</hi> becauſe they would <hi>not believe</hi> the Goſpel, when it was <hi>preached</hi> to them; And indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> for the <hi>moſt</hi> part when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was preached to them, did not only <hi>not barely believe</hi> it, but were <hi>contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> againſt it, and <hi>perſecuted</hi> the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it: As will appear by the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi>

               <p>The Apoſtle by the word <hi>Riches</hi> uſeth to ſignifie an <hi>abundance,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Chap.</hi>

               <p>Many Interpreters do joyn the 22. and 23. verſes together, as though their were nothing <hi>defective</hi> here, and that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would give us to know here, that God <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured with much long ſuffering</hi> the Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, and ſo <hi>hardened them,</hi> for <hi>two</hi> reaſons; <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he might ſhew his <hi>wrath,</hi> and make his <hi>power</hi> known in the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of thoſe veſſels of wrath: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> that by his <hi>ſeverity</hi> ſhewed on the <hi>Veſſells of Wrath:</hi> He might make his <hi>mercy</hi> more <hi>conſpicuous,</hi> and <hi>higher</hi> to be valued, which he <hi>ſheweth</hi> to the <hi>Veſſels</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> for a <hi>Contrary</hi> ſets off and illuſtrates its <hi>Contrary;</hi> And that which is <hi>common</hi> to many, is not <hi>ſo much</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteemed of, as that which appertains to <hi>few.</hi>

               <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>righteouſneſs by faith,</hi> was that they were <hi>offended at Chriſt</hi> (by the <hi>faith of whom</hi> only, <hi>Juſtification</hi> is to be had) and <hi>rejected</hi> him, and evilly <hi>entreated</hi> him, to their own <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>ruine,</hi> by bringing <hi>a ſin</hi> upon their head, and <hi>putting away</hi> from them the <hi>only means</hi> of obtaining Remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Jews rejected Chriſt</hi> and were offended at him, was becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in ſuch a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> manner, without any wordly <hi>Pomp,</hi> being born (according to the <hi>fleſh</hi>) of <hi>poor</hi> parentage, and having not an <hi>houſe</hi> of his own where to <hi>lay</hi> his head; Whereas they <hi>looked</hi> for a <hi>Pompous Meſſiah</hi> to come with all <hi>worldly Glory</hi> and <hi>Luſtre,</hi> miſtaking the <hi>propheſies</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſpoke <hi>gloriouſly</hi> of him, and interpreting them of <hi>Earthly, Outward</hi> or <hi>worldly Glory;</hi> when they were to be taken in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſence, for <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Glory.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is contained in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter, Behold I lay in Sion a chief Corner ſtone, elect precious and he that believeth in him ſhall not be confounded, unto you therefore which believe he is precious: But to them which be diſobedient, the ſtone which the builders diſallowed, the ſame is made the head ſtone of the Corner and a ſtone of Stumbling and a Rock of Offence, even to them which ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient whereto alſo they were appointed,</hi> 1 Pet.

                     <hi>1.</hi> BRethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">1. And now, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that which I left unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the beginning of the ninth chapter (though in other words) and may here perfect it: Brethren my hearts deſire and prayer for the Jews is, that they may be juſtified.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2. For though there is talk of their zeal towards God, as though ſuch zealous men could not but be juſtified, I am alſo ready to bear them witneſs, that they have a zeal of God, yet are they not therefore juſtified, becauſe their zeal is not according to knowledge.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="3">3. For they being ignorant of the way of Juſtification, which God hath appointed and as it were ſcored out to us, and going about to eſtabliſh, and maintain that way of Juſtification, which they themſelves have invented and choſen to themſelves, they have not ſubmitted themſelves to that way of Juſtification, which God hath appointed, to approve thereof and walk therein.</p>

                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> For Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="4">4. For whereas Chriſt is ſet forth to be the way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through faith in him, to every one that believeth, and the Law it ſelf pointed at him for this, as its end; the Jews have rejected him, and refuſed to believe in him.</p>

                     <hi>5</hi> For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live by them.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="5">5. But though I ſaid, that the Law it ſelf, pointed at Chriſt for this, as at its end, let no man therefore think that the way of Juſtification, which the Law preſcribeth, and the way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is by Faith, and which the Goſpel holds out to us, is all one: for <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is of the Law, in this manner; ſaying, that the man, which doth thoſe things exactly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt failer in that, which the law requireth ſhall be juſtified by them.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> But the righteouſneſs which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven? That is to bring Chriſt down from above.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="6">6. But the Preacher of that Juſtification, which is by faith, ſaith, but (that thou maiſt not think, that this juſtification, which is by the faith of Chriſt, is as far from being attained, as that which is by the Law) ſay not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven, to wit, to bring down Chriſt from above?</p>

               <p n="7">7. Or who ſhall deſcend into Hell to bring up Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead? as though it were any way neceſſary for us, for the attaining of juſtification by faith, that Chriſt ſhould be bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="14">14. And note here the Jews, which are ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gentiles, and would not that Preachers ſhould be ſent to them, that when the Scripture ſaith, whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved, It ſaith, that the Gentiles ſhall call upon the name of the Lord for ſalvation aſwel as the Jews: But now how ſhall they call on him for ſalvation, in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> And how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="15">15. And how ſhall any preach except they be ſent? Wherefore, preachers of the Goſpel have been ſent to the Gentiles: And the Gentiles have heard them effectually and believed: For they have received the preachers of the Goſpel joyfully, and have ſaid of them as it is written, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52.7. How beautiful are the feet of them, which preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things, and how wellcome are they to us?</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> But they have not all obeyed the Goſpel. For Eſaias ſaith, Lord who hath believed our report?</p>
               </q>
               <p n="16">16. But though the Gentiles have heard the preachers of the Goſpel joyfully, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved their preaching yet the Jews have not All, yea very few of them, have believed the Goſpel, for as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid of them long ſince, in the perſon of the preachers of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.1. Lord who among them, hath believed our report? So is it come to paſs.</p>

                  <p n="17">
                     <hi>17.</hi> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="17">17. But when the Prophet ſaith; Lord who hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our report? note here by the way, that that which I treated of a little before, is plain from hence alſo, to wit, That faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God preached, ſo that it was needful that the word ſhould be preached to the Gentiles, that they might believe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>18.</hi> But I ſay, have they not heard? Yes verily, their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world:</p>
               </q>
               <p n="18">18. But to go on; Perhaps ſome will ſay, that if the Jews believe not, it is becauſe they have not heard the Goſpel preached to them: But I ſay, have they not heard the Goſpel preached? Yes verily they have heard it; For the ſound of the Apoſtles, is gone into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world, and this could not, nor ought to have been, before the Goſpel had been fully preached to the Jews.</p>

               <p n="19">19. But becauſe the Jews think it ſtrange, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould be called by the preaching of the Goſpel, and the Goſpel ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; I ask, did not the Jews know of the calling of the Gentiles? They muſt needs know of it they could not be ignorant of it; for the Lord ſaith in the book of <hi>Moſes</hi> called <hi>Deuteronomy: Chap.</hi> 32.21. I will provoke you, O ye ſons of Iſrael, to jealouſie by the heathen which are now no people of mine, and by a fooliſh Nation, that is, by the Gentiles, I will anger you, to wit, by making them as neer to my ſelf as ye are.</p>

                  <hi>Saving</hi> or <hi>juſtifying faith</hi> is a faith, which as I ſaid, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver</hi> 17. comes up ſo <hi>high,</hi> as that it doth ſet a man on <hi>work</hi> to do thoſe things, which God by his <hi>new covenant</hi> with him, <hi>requires</hi> of him; as the <hi>caſe</hi> requires, and as <hi>opportunity</hi> ſerves; ſo that he muſt be <hi>ready</hi> at all times in the <hi>preparation of his heart,</hi> to <hi>confeſs</hi> with his <hi>mouth</hi> the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and not only that, but to do <hi>every good work alſo:</hi> and this is that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intimates here, willing, that we ſhould know that <hi>Juſtifying faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is not a <hi>dead, barren,</hi> or <hi>fruitleſs</hi> faith, but an <hi>operative</hi> faith, which will bring forth <hi>good</hi> works as <hi>opportunity</hi> offers it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, by that which he ſaith of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with the mouth,</hi> underſtand all <hi>good works</hi> beſides, as well as <hi>that:</hi> But he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make <hi>mention</hi> of this only (not to <hi>exclude</hi> other good <hi>works,</hi> but) becauſe the <hi>time</hi> in which he wrote this, might be a <hi>time of perſecution;</hi> with the <hi>Romans,</hi> or ſuch as that they might fear a <hi>perſecution;</hi> at which time <hi>confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the <hi>mouth,</hi> will be moſt <hi>requiſite;</hi> or becauſe he ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth.</hi> Therefore he may particularly mention the <hi>confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the <hi>mouth.</hi> And for the ſame reaſon alſo he may ſay, <hi>and ſhalt believe in thy heart</hi> expreſſing thoſe words <hi>in thine heart,</hi> here becauſe he ſaid before, <hi>and in thine heart,</hi> verſe 8.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>report</hi> was not from the Preachers and Apoſtles, as originally from themſelves: but it was that which they received from <hi>God,</hi> for that did they teach and preach to the Jews, as Gods word, and that only.</p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God]</hi> This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gathers out of thoſe words, ver. 16. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port there, is the report <hi>of remiſſion of ſins and by Chriſt,</hi> which report, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> of the word brought to the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>God</hi> and it was brought to them, that they might <hi>hear it,</hi> and that <hi>hearing</hi> it, they might <hi>believe</hi> it. And this is the <hi>only</hi> means which God uſeth for the begetting of <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>concluſion</hi> which the Apoſtle gathereth here <hi>by the by,</hi> for it it not <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> to that buſineſs which he is <hi>now</hi> upon, to wit, to ſhew <hi>the unbelief of the</hi> Jews.

               <p>And here <hi>obſerve</hi> again that which I have obſerved heretofore, that the <hi>Apoſtle when he hath treated before of any ſubject, and is paſſed from it, yet though he hath paſſed from it, if any new argument ariſe which will prove that ſubject from which he hath paſſed, he doth for the moſt part take notice of it, though it be but by the by;</hi> and ſo doth he here, to prove, what he ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.15.</p>

               <p>Theſe words relate not to the 17 verſe but to the 16 verſe <hi>of this Chapter.</hi> And by them the Apoſtle <hi>prevents</hi> an <hi>objection.</hi> For whereas he ſaid, verſe 16. <hi>But they have not all obeyed the Goſpel.

               <p>Wherefore note, that in <hi>natural ingraffings of trees</hi> or <hi>plants,</hi> the <hi>Cions</hi> of the <hi>good Olive</hi> is to be graffed into the <hi>wild olive-tree.</hi> The <hi>wild Olive-tree</hi> or <hi>Cion thereof,</hi> is not to be graffed into the good <hi>Olive-tree</hi> (as the <hi>Cion</hi> of the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> is to be graffed into the <hi>Crab-ſtock</hi> not the <hi>Cion of the Crab-tree</hi> into the <hi>Apple-ſtock</hi>) But here the <hi>Olive tree,</hi> which is <hi>wilde</hi> by nature, is graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>good Olive tree.</hi>

               <p>Then we <hi>offer our bodies,</hi> that is, <hi>our ſelves a living Sacrifice to God,</hi> when we <hi>direct all</hi> our actions, and do <hi>all</hi> which we do, to his <hi>glory;</hi> according to the <hi>expoſition</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives of his <hi>meaning,</hi> in the <hi>laſt</hi> words of this <hi>verſe.</hi>

               <p>The ſacrifices of the Old Law were <hi>called holy,</hi> and were ſo <hi>accounted.</hi> But if they were called and accounted <hi>holy,</hi> Surely the <hi>bodies of Chriſtians</hi> may be called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>holy,</hi> much more, being that they are <hi>purified</hi> from <hi>ſin</hi> by the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. and <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15 16.</p>

               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>Recompence to no man evil for evil] i. e.</hi> If any man hath injured thee, revenge not thy ſelf upon him.</p>
               <p>This precept concerns <hi>private men:</hi> for he which is <hi>in publique authority</hi> is the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil, Cap.</hi> 13.4.

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you lieth live peaceably with all men]</hi> Such is the nature of ſome men, as that there is no <hi>peace</hi> to be had with them, therefore the Apoſtle gives that in command here, not which depends upon <hi>other</hi> men, and is <hi>in them;</hi> but which is <hi>in our own power.</hi>

                  <hi>Aſmuch as in you lieth]</hi> Where a man doth what in him lieth, to live peaceably, and cannot becauſe of the perverſneſs of other men, he hath done his duty.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>Avenge not your ſelves]</hi> i. e. <hi>Revenge</hi> is not the way to procure peace, but rather to begin <hi>endleſs diſcords;</hi> and therefore doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> here in this place command us <hi>not to avenge our ſelves,</hi> becauſe he gave a precept of <hi>enſuing peace</hi> immediately before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> touched upon this precept before <hi>verſe</hi> 17. but here he <hi>reſums</hi> it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that he might <hi>back</hi> it with ſound reaſons, as being a moſt <hi>difficult</hi> precept to our nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But rather give place unto wrath] i. e.</hi> But rather, when <hi>wrath</hi> comes towards you, <hi>give place to her,</hi> and <hi>get away</hi> from her, that ſhe may not take <hi>hold</hi> of you, or be with you, to ſtir you up to revenge.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>wrath</hi> is, there is <hi>deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks here of <hi>wrath,</hi> as of a <hi>Perſon</hi> by a <hi>proſopopoeia</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wrath is apt to ſtir men up to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on them which anger them, therefore doth the Apoſtle wiſh men here to give place, that is, to fly from wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is written]</hi> Viz. <hi>Deut</hi> 32.35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vengeance is mine I will repay ſaith the Lord]</hi> This is an argument againſt our <hi>revenging our ſelves.</hi> For by <hi>revenging our ſelves</hi> we intrench upon that which is <hi>Gods peculiar:</hi> for it is written. <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will repay] i. e.</hi> I will repay or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe vengeance, upon him which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth it.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the pronoun <hi>I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hinders not, but that <hi>vengeance</hi> may belong to <hi>Magiſtrates;</hi> for they are <hi>Gods Miniſters and Revengers,</hi> Cap. 13.4 And therefore, the <hi>vengeance,</hi> which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, is <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him, if he thirſt, give him drink] q. d.</hi> Be thou therefore ſo far from avenging thy ſelf, as that if thine enemy <hi>hunger, feed</hi> him: or if he <hi>thirſt,</hi> give him <hi>drink,</hi> that is, if he ſtand in need of any thing that thou canſt do for him, do it.</p>
               <p>This is taken out of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 25, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thine enemy] i. e.</hi> If he who hateth thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in ſo doing]</hi> That is, by feeding him when he hungreth, and by giving him drink, wben he is thirſty, that is, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him freely, what he ſtands in need of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head]</hi> That is, thou ſhalt heap, as it were, <hi>coals of fire on his head,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt <hi>purge him, to wit,</hi> of his <hi>enmity</hi> towards thee, and make him become thy friend, whereas he was thine enemy before.</p>
               <p>This ſence agreeth with the following verſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeemeth to me to uſe a <hi>Metaphor</hi> here drawn from <hi>Metals,</hi> whoſe <hi>droſs</hi> is <hi>purged</hi> by <hi>fire,</hi> for the <hi>Refiners</hi> uſe not only to put coals under, but alſo to <hi>heap up coals of fire</hi> upon the metal (or upon the head of the refining pot, or crucible, wherein the metal is melted) that the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal being covered with coals of fire, may the ſooner, or the better be melted or refined, though under ordinary ſeething pots, they onely put coals under to make them ſeeth.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Metaphor</hi> the works of <hi>Charity,</hi> in feeding and giving drink are likened to the <hi>coals of fire,</hi> in the <hi>purifying of metals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fire</hi> is oftentimes uſed Metaphorically in the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> yet never <hi>oftener</hi> than it is for <hi>purging,</hi> or purifying. Thus are the words of the Lord ſaid to be <hi>pure words</hi> even as the <hi>ſilver,</hi> which from the earth is <hi>tryed</hi> and <hi>purified</hi> ſeven times in <hi>the fire, Pſ.</hi> 12.17.</p>
               <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Be not overcome of evill] i. e. Evil</hi> is here a noun of the <hi>neuter</hi> gender, and therefore is to be taken for <hi>malice</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is overcome of evill,</hi> which will ſin againſt another, becauſe another hath <hi>ſinned</hi> againſt him: Or which will do <hi>hurt to another,</hi> becauſe <hi>another hath done hurt to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But overcome evil with good] He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes evill with good:</hi> which with kindneſs and works of <hi>Charity,</hi> maketh
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59465:152"/> him who was his <hi>enemy</hi> and did him <hi>wrong</hi> before, to be his friend, and ready to do him good now.</p>
               <p>This is the beſt means to overcome evil. For <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>He ſpeaks here, no doubt, of lawful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle goeth on to ſhew how we ſhould preſent our ſelves a <hi>Living ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice holy and acceptable unto God,</hi> as he ſpake <hi>Cap.</hi> 12 <hi>v.</hi> 4. and how we ſhould <hi>be transformed from the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By every <hi>duty</hi> which we perform as we ought, we preſent our ſelves <hi>a ſacrifice to God:</hi> yet doth not the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here, in theſe his precepts <hi>inſiſt upon,</hi> or mention <hi>every</hi> duty, which lies upon us, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but <hi>only ſome,</hi> neither in thoſe, which he doth mention, doth he <hi>enlarge</hi> himſelf upon all <hi>a like.</hi> Now the reaſon of this, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they to whom he wrote, had more need to be taught or put in mind of <hi>ſome</hi> precepts more than <hi>other,</hi> and to have <hi>ſome</hi> precepts more urged upon them, than <hi>others,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>contrary</hi> ſins, which they were moſt prone unto.</p>
               <p>And as for that, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> urgeth ſo earneſtly here, <hi>ſubjection to the higheſt powers,</hi> he ſeemeth to urge it eſpecially; Becauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> (many whereof lived at <hi>Rome</hi>) for the <hi>Jews</hi> generally (becauſe they pretended themſelves to be <hi>the people of God)</hi> would not be <hi>ſubject</hi> to any <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> or <hi>heathen power,</hi> read <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 35. &amp;c.

They ask whether it <hi>be lawfull to pay tribute to</hi> Caeſar <hi>or no.</hi> But though the Apoſtle took an <hi>occaſion</hi> from thence, to give this <hi>precept,</hi> yet by what he ſaith, he would have <hi>no man</hi> to think himſelf exempted from <hi>ſubjection</hi> to the <hi>powers</hi> aforeſaid (no not the <hi>faithfull</hi>) under any pretext or colour of Religion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>the order of this precept;</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle may give this <hi>precept</hi> here in this place, to ſhew, that though he ſaid <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp;c. For it is written vengeance is mine, I will repay it ſaith the Lord:</hi> yet he did not intend to prejudice <hi>Magiſtrates thereby,</hi> but that God did repay his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (for a great part) by <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For there is no power, but of God] i. e.</hi> For there is no power, throughout the whole world lawfully conſtituted, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, whether it be Jewiſh or whether it be Gentile, but it is of God.</p>
               <p>I take <hi>power</hi> here as before, for men <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power,</hi> yea with the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power in a Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> extends his ſpeech to <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every the higheſt powers</hi> in the world, to have the <hi>Jew</hi> know, that God ordained <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and <hi>Magiſtitrates</hi> among <hi>other people;</hi> as well as he had done among <hi>them,</hi> which alſo they, and all others muſt <hi>obey,</hi> while they live <hi>under them.</hi>

               <p>But now how are the <hi>powers</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>powers</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>manner or kind</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, limited or appointed in every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nation, as <hi>Monarchical, Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Democratical,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Perſons</hi> deſigned or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear rule in theſe <hi>Governments</hi> reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>power it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> with which theſe perſons are endued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, to act in theſe ſaid ſeveral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And <hi>every</hi> one of theſe, we ſay, <hi>are of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God, when the Children of Iſrael deſired a <hi>King,</hi> condeſcended to their deſire, and ordered that People to be ruled by a <hi>Kingly</hi> or <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8 9. And he did not only limit or appoint the <hi>Government,</hi> but he did alſo deſign the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> who ſhould <hi>govern</hi> and bare rule in and manage that Government: For he <hi>firſt</hi> deſigned <hi>Saul</hi> to be King over Iſrael, and after him <hi>David</hi> and his <hi>poſterity ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,</hi> ſo that theſe <hi>powers</hi> were <hi>immediately of God,</hi> and ordained of him immediately in every reſpect. But God hath not done ſo for every people, <hi>immediately</hi> to order their manner or kinde of Government, and to deſign their <hi>Governors</hi> with an immediate deſignment; yet nevertheleſs may all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>powers</hi> of the world be ſaid to be of God, and <hi>ordained</hi> by him: even in reſpect of the <hi>manner</hi> of Government and the perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned thereunto.</p>
               <p>For though we ſuppoſe, that the ſeveral Governments of the world, as they are at this time, were conſtituted and ordained by the <hi>agreement</hi> and conſent of <hi>ſeveral</hi> people <hi>reſpectively</hi> at the firſt; and that their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governors were deſigned by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, to their ſeveral places of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without the particular deſignment and revelation of God: yet may this alſo be ſaid to be <hi>of God Firſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> endued man with wiſdom and prudence to provide for his peace and welfare, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choice of ſuch <hi>Governments,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Governors</hi> to rule over them, as would be moſt conducible thereunto. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe what men do in this kind, they do not without the providence of <hi>God,</hi> who works all things <hi>according to the pleaſure of his own will,</hi> though by <hi>mediate</hi> ways, and <hi>ſeveral</hi> means: and who is King over all the Earth, and therefore hath a more ſpecial providence in the Regiment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>But though the conſtitution of this <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>deſignation</hi> of the <hi>perſons</hi> to Govern, is not always <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> yet the <hi>power</hi> with which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and the <hi>authority</hi> with which they are inveſted, are ſurely from him <hi>immediately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to the proof of this (to omit others) the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſuppeditates three Arguments, in this Chapter: For <hi>first,</hi> he ſaith that the <hi>Ruler is the Miniſter of God ver.</hi> 4. And why rather then becauſe he is <hi>Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerant,</hi> and hath his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from <hi>God? Secondly,</hi> he ſaith that he <hi>beareth the Sword v.</hi> 4. And he beareth it no doubt to cut of them from the land of the living, who deſerve death. But who can give this <hi>power</hi> to any one, but he which is <hi>the Lord of life and death?</hi> for what man hath this power over himſelf, to uſe the Sword upon himſelf, though he judgeth himſelf a <hi>Malefactor</hi> and <hi>worthy of death,</hi> that he ſhould reſign, or give up this power to any other, either <hi>Community</hi> or <hi>Single perſon? Thirdly,</hi> he ſaith that he <hi>is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute wrath upon him that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ver.</hi> 4. And who can make a Ruler a Revenger, and give him this power, but he that ſaith, <hi>Vengeance is mine? Deut.</hi> 32.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19.</p>
               <p>As therefore in the generation of <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>diſpoſition of the matter</hi> is from a <hi>man,</hi> but the <hi>infuſion of the Soul</hi> is from God: ſo it is for the moſt part in the creation of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Rulers, Governors,</hi> or <hi>Powers;</hi> for though the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the kinde of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the <hi>deſignation</hi> of the Perſons be <hi>ordinarily</hi> from men, as their <hi>immediate cauſe;</hi> yet the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> which is the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of all, is <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> who giveth power to the <hi>ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi> ſutable to their <hi>ſeveral</hi> kind of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> which are thus <hi>deſigned</hi> and thus <hi>inveſted</hi> with <hi>ſupreme power</hi> in what kind <hi>of government</hi> ſoever, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in that which is <hi>Monarchical;</hi> are as <hi>ſacred</hi> as was the <hi>perſon of Saul,</hi> who was choſen <hi>immediately</hi> of God to be <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> of whom <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould ſtretch forth my hand againſt the Lords annointed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.11. For when by the <hi>diſpoſing</hi> hand of <hi>Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> is conveyed to a <hi>perſon,</hi> or to a <hi>perſon</hi> and his <hi>Line</hi> ſucceſſively, to the <hi>ſupreme power</hi> or Rule of a Nation, though

               <p>
                  <hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God] i. e.</hi> All the Lawful <hi>powers,</hi> that is, All the Lawful <hi>Rulers</hi> throughout the whole world (and not they which are of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> only) are ordained of God.</p>

               <p>That which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>this</hi> verſe, is a <hi>Corollary</hi> drawn from that which he ſaid in the <hi>former verſe,</hi> viz. <hi>There is no power but of God, the powers that be are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</hi> A <hi>Corollarie</hi> not impertinent to his preſent diſcourſe, and very fit for the <hi>Jews</hi> to take notice of, who upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of that, that they were <hi>Gods people,</hi> would not willingly be ſubject to any <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then power,</hi> but would <hi>reſiſt</hi> it, <hi>oppoſe</hi> it, and take Arms againſt it, as occaſion was.</p>

               <p>Now for the connexion of this with that which went before: The Apoſtle ſeems to prevent an Objection here: for they might object and ſay, that if they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe powers, and put their necks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their yoke, they ſhould ever be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, For ſuch powers are a terror to them which live under them.</p>
               <p>This Objection I ſay the Apoſtle ſeems to prevent, as if he ſhould ſay in theſe or the like words; But ye have no reaſon to fear this if ye do well (and if ye do ill ye are worthy to ſuffer for it.) For Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>benefit</hi> to all perſons which live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any goverment, that the <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi> are <hi>not a terror,</hi> that is, are <hi>an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,</hi> and are <hi>Rewarders of them
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59465:155"/> which do well:</hi> And it is a <hi>benefit</hi> to them too, that they are a <hi>terror</hi> to them which do evil.

               <p>Note, that when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good works but to the Evil,</hi> and here again, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> It was not, nor is it his intent to give theſe or any of theſe <hi>dictates,</hi> as a <hi>meaſure of our obedience;</hi> as though he would have us to obey <hi>Rulers</hi> while they are this, and do this, and no longer: But he brings them only as <hi>perſwaſive</hi> arguments <hi>why we ſhould obey.</hi> So that if <hi>Rulers</hi> do not their duty to us, we are not <hi>freed,</hi> by any thing which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſays, from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ours</hi> to them. Wherefore what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>good ſervants,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. may be ſaid as well to <hi>good Subjects</hi> as to <hi>good ſervants, viz.</hi> Be <hi>ſubject with all fear not only to the good and gentle; but alſo to the froward. For this is thank worthy if a man for conſcience towards God, endureth grief, ſuffering wrongfully</hi> Yea, if thou art a <hi>good Chriſtian</hi> and haſt learned Chriſt <hi>throughly:</hi> A <hi>Ruler,</hi> be he never ſo <hi>bad,</hi> cannot be a <hi>terror</hi> to thee, if thou doſt well, nor can he be otherwiſe then a <hi>Miniſter of God to thee for good;</hi> for if he ſhould puniſh thee unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly and perſecute thee, yet if thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it patiently <hi>God</hi> will abundantly <hi>reward</hi> thee for that thy <hi>patient ſuffering,</hi> in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commands; ſo that <hi>his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and perſecutions ſhall turn to <hi>thy good,</hi> though he intends it not ſo: For <hi>our affliction worketh for us a far more exceeding weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>

For the <hi>Jews</hi> were never forward in paying tribute to any <hi>Heathen power,</hi> but when tribute was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they raiſed commotions and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions upon it, as we may read <hi>Acts</hi> 5.37. And in <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> and others; wherefore there was need of a <hi>particular precept</hi> for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tribute</hi> was <hi>money</hi> raiſed upon the goods and lands of the People, according to their ability, for the ſupport of the <hi>Rulers</hi> in their great and expenſive offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To pay tribute</hi> is a part of <hi>ſubjection</hi> but though the Apoſtle had given a charge to the <hi>Romans</hi> in general <hi>to be ſubject;</hi> yet doth he add this in particular, that they ſhould <hi>pay Tribute;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> (many of which lived at this time at <hi>Rome</hi>) were averſe from it. And it is a part of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique, to mention a <hi>particular</hi> after a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> or a <hi>ſpecies</hi> after a <hi>genus,</hi> when there is a <hi>reaſon</hi> for taking <hi>ſpecial</hi> notice of the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>

               </p>
               <p>What this thing was which they attended on, we muſt gather from what went before.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Rulers</hi> are <hi>Gods Miniſters,</hi> and attend by his appointment, upon <hi>our good,</hi> they are worthy of <hi>tribute</hi> upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Firſt,</hi> as they are <hi>Gods Miniſters,</hi> (whoſe is the <hi>Earth</hi> and all things therein contained) And <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe they do attend upon <hi>our good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an argument to perſwade to the willing paying of tribute.</p>

               <p>Honour is the ſign of an eſteem which we have of anothers excellency.

               <p>This is a <hi>new</hi> precept <hi>different</hi> from that which went before, though perhaps it may have its place here, by occaſion of thoſe words, Viz. <hi>Render to all their dues, Ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former precept,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath amplified and purſued from the <hi>first</hi> verſe of this Chapter hitherto, concerned the <hi>duty of ſubjects</hi> towards thoſe which were their <hi>Rulers,</hi> as ſuch. But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept concerns the duty of a <hi>private man</hi> to a <hi>private man</hi> as ſuch.</p>
               <p>There be <hi>duties</hi> or <hi>debts</hi> which when they are once paid, are <hi>due no more,</hi> as debts for mony borrowed, wares bought, or the like: and there are ſuch <hi>dues</hi> or <hi>debts,</hi> which we muſt continually <hi>pay,</hi> as we have occaſion, and yet they will never be <hi>quite paid,</hi> or never be ſo paid, as that we <hi>owe</hi> them not any more, and ſuch are the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>love,</hi> which we owe (by vertue of Gods command) every one, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>But perhaps we may ſay, in anſwer to the aforeſaid objection, that the Apoſtle gives this his precept, not to <hi>ſubjects</hi> as <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and in relation to their ſuperiors, but to private men in relation to Private-men. And therefore this objection hath <hi>no place</hi> here, becauſe here there is no ſuch duty, as <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> due from any one, to any one, to whom this <hi>precept</hi> is directed.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive as probable, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> though he reckoneth <hi>other the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the ſecond Table, in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

               <p>Theſe commandments are alſo all of them delivered <hi>Negatively:</hi> But in theſe <hi>Negatives</hi> the contrary <hi>affirmative</hi> duties are included.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adultery]</hi> Under the name of <hi>Adultery</hi> underſtand <hi>Inceſt, fornication,</hi> and the like, as well as <hi>Adultery,</hi> ſtrictly taken.</p>
               <p>It may be asked here, why the Apoſtle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the firſt commandment of the ſecond Table, to wit, <hi>Honor thy father &amp; thy mother, that thy days may be long in the Land, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks here onely of ſuch and to ſuch, as are in an e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quality, in reſpect of <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>ſubjection,</hi> having ſpoken of <hi>ſubjects as ſubjects,</hi> and in relation to their <hi>Rulers,</hi> as ſo, from the <hi>beginning</hi> of this Chapter to the eighth verſe.</p>
               <p>Or elſe we muſt ſay, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves that commandment in thoſe words, <hi>And if there be any other commandment.</hi> But the firſt ſeems to me to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable anſwer.</p>
               <p>It may be asked again, that whereas in the twentieth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Law is repeated, the precept or command concerning Murder, is put before the command concerning Adultery: Why the precept or command concerning <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> is put here before that of <hi>Murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this we cannot give an anſwer, except it be, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought that the <hi>Romans</hi> were chiefly to be admoniſhed of <hi>the ſins of the fleſh,</hi> which were ſins moſt riſe amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſins reducible to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi>

                  <hi>Knowing the time, that it is now high time to awake out of ſleep] i. e.</hi> Knowing the time to be ſuch, as that it is high time for us, now (even your ſelves being Judges) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of ſleep.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſleep</hi> here ſpoken of is <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> to be taken, not for <hi>the ſleep of the body</hi> but of the <hi>mind.</hi> Now as <hi>the ſleep of the body</hi> is the <hi>tying up as it were of the ſenſes,</hi> ſo that they which are aſleep are quiet, and perform not any humane, and external function, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time: ſo is this <hi>Metaphorical ſleep</hi> here, a <hi>tying up,</hi> as it were, or a <hi>ceſſation</hi> or <hi>rest</hi> of the mind from good and vertuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but yet with a freedom and active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in, or to that which is vicious.</p>
               <p>Note, that the Apoſtle uſeth an <hi>Allegory</hi> here, in which he alludes to certain <hi>War-like</hi> or <hi>Millitary</hi> paſſages. Now therefore as <hi>Souldiers</hi> are often times alarmed, and called up by the ſound of the <hi>Drum</hi> or Trumpet out of their ſleep to do their <hi>Millitary</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo doth our Apoſtle in alluſion to that, call upon the <hi>Romans</hi> here to awake out of this their ſleep, to fall to their <hi>Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> as being high time for them, ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For now is our ſalvation neerer then when we believed] q. d.</hi> For now is our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come neerer to us, to reſcue and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; then it was when we firſt believed; Let us therefore Rowſe up our ſelves and fall to our <hi>ſpiritual weapons,</hi> that we may break through all our <hi>enemies,</hi> and get through them ſafe, to this our <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Argument to perſwade, that it is time to awake out of <hi>ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle alludes here to men <hi>beſieged,</hi> who having ſuccours drawn neer to them to relieve them, and deliver them, break out with all courage through their Enemies, to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now is our ſalvation neerer then when we believed]</hi> By <hi>ſalvation</hi> is meant here, that which the <hi>School</hi> calls <hi>Salvation Compleate,</hi> which is that <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> which the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall one day enjoy in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Salvation</hi> doth the Apoſtle ſpeak here as of a <hi>Perſon,</hi> yea, a <hi>Captain</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reſcue of his <hi>beſieged</hi> party, by a <hi>Proſopopoeia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here he ſpeaks, or conceives at the leaſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom he writes, as of ſuch as are <hi>beſieged</hi> and <hi>compaſſed</hi> about with the <hi>luſts of the fleſh,</hi> the <hi>vanities</hi> of the world, and <hi>temptations</hi> of the Devil, as their <hi>enemies,</hi> through which they muſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59465:157"/> breake, to come to Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> may be ſaid to approach to the reſcue of <hi>men,</hi> thus beſieged with their <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enemies,</hi> in that they which apprehend <hi>ſalvation</hi> with a ſtrong <hi>faith,</hi> and hope for it, are ſo <hi>animated</hi> thereby, as that they break through all the <hi>temptations</hi> and <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> of this world, that they may at length attain to her, becauſe of her ineſtimable value, and unconceivable excellency; for, <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> ads great courage to ſuch as believe and hope after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> may be ſaid to be now nearer to the <hi>Romans</hi> at this time; than it was when they did firſt <hi>believe</hi> and were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: In that there had ſome time paſſed between this time, and the time that they <hi>firſt</hi> believed; for the time of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>fixed,</hi> it went not <hi>backward,</hi> ſo that the longer they lived, the nearer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to it.</p>
               <p>Though in this ſence, we are rather to be ſaid, to approach nearer to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> than <hi>ſalvation</hi> to us, yet he ſaith, that <hi>ſalvation approacheth to us,</hi> or <hi>draweth near to us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpeaks of <hi>ſalvation</hi> under a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or, as of a <hi>Perſon</hi> (as I ſaid before) coming to relieve her friend as beſieged.</p>
               <p>Note here, that the <hi>Romans</hi> when they firſt believed and received the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> were very <hi>active</hi> then, and <hi>zealous</hi> of good works, watching (as I may ſo ſay) thereunto, in hope of <hi>Eternal ſalvation approaching:</hi> But after a while, they <hi>flag'd</hi> and <hi>ſlacked,</hi> and <hi>fell,</hi> as it were, <hi>a ſleep,</hi> and grew cold and <hi>neglective</hi> of good works, which they had followed heretofore. And this was that which made the Apoſtle to <hi>awake</hi> them here out of this <hi>ſleep;</hi> putting them in mind of their <hi>ſalvation,</hi> that if they thought it time to awake out of <hi>ſleep,</hi> and were thereupon <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi> to good works, when they <hi>firſt</hi> believed, in <hi>hope of ſalvation then approaching;</hi> much more ſhould they think it now <hi>high</hi> time to <hi>awake</hi> out of ſleep, and <hi>watch</hi> to good works, being that that <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which they hoped for and expected, was <hi>nearer</hi> to them now than it was <hi>then.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks here to ſuch as were <hi>ſtrong in the faith;</hi> that is, <hi>to ſuch as were perſwaded, that the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Chriſt, and had not power to obliege Chriſtians to the obſervance of meats and days, as it did the Jews while it was in force: So that they might lawfully eat thoſe meats which were forbidden to be eaten by the Law of Moſes, And might lawfully omit the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of thoſe days, which the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made holy.</hi> And he ſpeaks to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>weak,</hi> that is, concerning <hi>ſuch as were not ſo perſwaded, but obſerved the choiſe of meats and days as Moſes had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, out of the weakneſs of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> towards whom he would have them carry themſelves, withall prudence and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> directs this his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or precept to <hi>all the Saints</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> which were ſtrong in the <hi>faith,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpeaks here only to ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as were ſtrong in the faith, is a queſtion. Some take it as ſpoken to <hi>all</hi> the ſtrong whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> Some again take it as ſpoken to <hi>ſuch Jews onely</hi> as were ſtrong; And the reaſons of theſe latter are theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſimply,</hi> it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> at this time no not for the <hi>weak Jews ſake,</hi> which they think is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> wherefore ſay they the Gentiles were not in any wiſe to be exhorted to that which is here written. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, ver. 3. <hi>Let not him which eateth not, judge him which eateth,</hi> that is, <hi>let not the weak which eateth not, condemn the ſtrong which eateth that which was forbidden by the Law of Moſes, as if he were thereby a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of that Law;</hi> which a <hi>Jew,</hi> though he were weak, would not do to a <hi>Gentile,</hi> becauſe he knew that the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to the <hi>Gentile,</hi> but to the <hi>Jew</hi> onely. And to theſe latter do I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> therefore directs this his precept by an <hi>Apoſtrophe,</hi> in particular, to ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as lived at <hi>Rome and were strong in the faith,</hi> concerning <hi>ſuch</hi> things, as were forbidden indeed by the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> but might be <hi>lawfully</hi> uſed by <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> And to ſuch doth he ſpeak, when he ſpeaks to the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> throughout this Chapter: But in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>next Chapter,</hi> he paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59465:161"/> from this <hi>ſpecial</hi> Doctrine, <hi>concerning things which were forbidden by the Law of Moſes,</hi> to that which is more <hi>general,</hi> and there ſpeaks to <hi>all,</hi> both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which were <hi>ſtrong in the faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for the <hi>Connexion</hi> of this with the former Chapter: The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> goes on ſtill to teach the <hi>Romans,</hi> how they ſhould <hi>preſent their bodies a living Sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is, their reaſonable ſervice</hi> (as he ſpeaks <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) And becauſe this <hi>precept</hi> is a precept of <hi>charity,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. He brings it in here after the precept of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> which he gave, in the latter part of the foregoing Chapter. Though in giving of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as theſe are, the <hi>coherence</hi> is not ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly</hi> to be looked for; no more than, in the <hi>Proverbs of Solomon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Him that is weak in the faith]</hi> He is ſaid <hi>to be weak in the faith,</hi> which doubteth of any thing concerning the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> or is perſwaded againſt the <hi>truth</hi> thereof; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that for truth which is not true. Such a one in this preſent caſe, was he which doubted whether he might Lawfully eat of ſuch meats as were forbidden, or which thought that he ſinned which did eat of ſuch meats as were forbidden to be eaten by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>He ſpeaks to ſuch <hi>Jews,</hi> as were <hi>ſtrong,</hi> that is, as were <hi>fully</hi> perſwaded (and that according to the Goſpel) that they might now lawfully eat thoſe meats which <hi>Moſes</hi> did forbid in his Law, to be eaten: And that they might lawfully neglect the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe <hi>days,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> would have obſerved by his Law.</p>

               <p>Should <hi>weak Jews,</hi> newly converted to the <hi>faith of Chriſt,</hi> be ſet upon by hot diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and contentions, that by thoſe means they might be drawn from the opinions which they held; they might as ſoon be driven from that <hi>faith</hi> which they had of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as be drawn from thoſe their <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> wherefore the Apoſtle would not have this, to be put to ſuch a venture.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>For one believeth that he may eat all things] i. e.</hi> Now one (who is ſtrong in faith) is fully perſwaded in his conſcience, that he may lawfully eat, all manner of meats whatſoever.</p>

               <p>Note, that the particle, <hi>For,</hi> may be taken here, for <hi>Now,</hi> as when we ſay <hi>Now</hi> the birth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was after this manner,</hi> Matth. 1.18. <hi>Now the God of patience and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grant you to be like minded one towards another,</hi> Chap. 15.5.

               <p>Note, that the word <hi>Onely</hi> is here to be underſtood, as it is often elſewhere. And that by <hi>Herbs,</hi> he means <hi>all ſuch herbs as were</hi> by their nature <hi>fit for the food of man.</hi> But yet by ſuch <hi>herbs,</hi> he doth by a <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> mean alſo <hi>all manner of meats whatſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever, which were not forbidden to be eaten by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And theſe <hi>meats</hi> he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies by Herbs, becauſe there were <hi>no Herbs</hi> forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be eaten; but it was lawful at all times, to eat any herbs, which man had a mind to eat, for food.</p>

                  <hi>Knowledge puffeth up</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corin</hi> 8.1. And ſo might it puff up the <hi>more knowing Jew,</hi> againſt him which was <hi>leſs knowing,</hi> even to the contempt of him, who was leſs inſtructed or <hi>strengthened in the faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all (as ſome think, and as I intimated before) which the Apoſtle here meaneth by <hi>deſpiſing,</hi> but by <hi>deſpiſing</hi> they think that the Apoſtle means, <hi>a ſlight accounting alſo of the ſalvation of a weak bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whereby a man does offend his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by eating ſuch meats as his brother thinks unlawful; and ſo makes him by <hi>his example</hi> to eat againſt his conſcience, that which he himſelf judgeth to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat, to his <hi>condemnation.</hi> And this indeed agrees with that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth] i. e.</hi> Let not him which eateth not all things, but abſtaineth for conſcience ſake, from many things (becauſe he thinks they may not be lawfully eaten) as being forbidden to be eaten by the <hi>Law of Moſes.</hi> Let not, I ſay, ſuch an one, judge him that eateth all things, out of a perſwaſion that he may lawfully eat them; as if he were a <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor</hi> of the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> and a <hi>ſinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Thus is this commonly interpreted of him whom he which eateth not, judgeth, becauſe he eateth, yet ſome interpret it not of him, whom he, which eateth not, judgeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he eateth; but of him, whom he, which eateth, deſpiſeth, becauſe he eateth not: and ſo refer it, not to thoſe words, which went <hi>immediately</hi> before.

               <p>The Apoſtle is here, very favourable to theſe <hi>Romans,</hi> which being <hi>weak</hi> in faith, did <hi>abſtain</hi> from meats, which were forbidden by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and did obſerve thoſe days as <hi>holy,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be <hi>kept</hi> holy, and makes an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> for them: Yet he is very angry with the <hi>Galatians</hi> for obſerving <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as may appear by divers paſſages of the fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> written to <hi>them</hi> A queſtion therefore may be asked, why the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>favourable</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> in this, and ſo <hi>ſharp</hi> to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks here, were ſuch as were <hi>Jews</hi> living at <hi>Rome</hi> and converted from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> who therefore were <hi>brought up</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to thoſe things, which were commanded, and forbidden therein <hi>reſpectively;</hi> for which cauſe the Apoſtle thought it fit to deal <hi>gently</hi> with them, leaſt by <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>ſharp</hi> dealing, they ſhould forſake the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>faith,</hi> rather than be ſuddenly brought off from thoſe obſervances, to which they had been <hi>accuſtomed</hi> all their days: And for that alſo that he would ſhew ſuch reverence to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as that <hi>it being dead,</hi> it ſhould be buried, as it were, with honour. But the <hi>Galatians</hi> to which he wrote, were ſuch as were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and had been all their life-time brought up in <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> never in <hi>Judaiſm:</hi> Therefore he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> to be impoſed upon them; but when they ſeemed to be willing to receive it (when falſe Apoſtles would have <hi>impoſed</hi> it upon them) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes them ſharply for it; leſt if he ſhould ſeem to <hi>tollerate</hi> it, or <hi>wink</hi> at it in them, it might be thought that <hi>the keeping of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law,</hi> was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to which <hi>faith</hi> onely is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Yet though the Apoſtle dealt thus <hi>gently</hi> and <hi>favourably</hi> with theſe <hi>Romans,</hi> that is, with theſe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> here, and would not have them to be received to doubtful diſputations concerning their opinions, yet he did ſuffer them but for <hi>a time,</hi> and did by little and little <hi>instruct</hi> them in the truth, and perſwade them concerning the abrogation of the <hi>Law of Moſes by Chriſt,</hi> as he had opportunity.</p>
               <p>That therefore theſe <hi>weak Jews</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did obſerve days, and abſtain from meats, according to the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>liberty</hi> or freedom which was purchaſed by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> It was not a thing <hi>commendable</hi> in them (for it did proceed from their weakneſs in the <hi>faith, ver.</hi> 1.) but was a <hi>fault</hi> in them <hi>rather;</hi> yet ſuch a <hi>fault,</hi> as the Apoſtle would <hi>excuſe,</hi> and have others, which were <hi>ſtrong</hi> in the faith to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> alſo; interpreting what they did to the <hi>better</hi> part, and looking charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to that, which was <hi>good</hi> or might be <hi>good</hi> in it.</p>

But how can I put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in my brothers way, by any meat that I eat, when as there is no meat which is unclean in it ſelf. And it muſt be now unclean in it ſelf, if it be a ſtumbling block or occaſion to fall, when as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law is abrogated, which made things unclean by forbidding them to be eaten.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers. <hi>I know, and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf, but yet to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is, as if it were unclean</hi> indeed. Therefore the eating of that which is not unclean in it ſelf, may be to thy brother a ſtumbling block and an occaſion of a fall to him, if he do but think that it is unclean.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:59465:165"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>To him that eſteemeth any thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean] i. e.</hi> To him that eſteemeth, or is perſwaded, that any thing is <hi>unclean,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in it ſelf;</hi> or becauſe it is forbidden by the <hi>ceremonial Law of Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To him it is unclean]</hi> To him it is, as if it were unclean, and it will, if he uſeth it, <hi>make</hi> him <hi>unclean</hi> and a <hi>ſinner,</hi> becauſe he uſeth it, with ſuch a thought, or ſuch a perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>that to him that thinketh any thing to be unclean, to him, it is unclean,</hi> not becauſe a mans <hi>thought</hi> can make that any way <hi>unclean,</hi> which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>clean;</hi> but becauſe the <hi>conſcience</hi> of him, that thinketh any thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, which is not ſo; <hi>bindes</hi> him as much to abſtain from it, as if it were <hi>unclean</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>Therefore the particle <hi>As,</hi> is here to be underſtood, that the ſence may be this, <hi>to him it is as unclean,</hi> a particle which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten left to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably]</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> prevents another objection here: For the <hi>ſtrong</hi> Chriſtian may ſay. If it be ſo that there is nothing unclean in it ſelf, being that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is abrogated, though a weak brother be offended, yet, why may not I lawfully uſe any meat that I have a mind to. This objection, I ſay, the Apoſtle prevents, ſaying. <hi>Yea, but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou not charitably.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, thou mayſt lawfully eat what thou haſt a mind to, becauſe nothing is unclean in it ſelf, and becauſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is abrogated, which made many things ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonially unclean, if thou doſt not offend a weak brother by thy eating, and thereby tranſgreſs the rule of charity; but if thou canſt not, uſe this liberty, but that thou muſt offend thy weak brother and grieve him, if thou eateſt; thou tranſgreſſeſt the Law of charity by eating and ſo ſinneſt.</p>
               <p>Note here, that we muſt not ſo uſe the <hi>liberty</hi> of things <hi>indifferent,</hi> but that in the uſe thereof we muſt <hi>be ſubject</hi> to the Law of <hi>charity,</hi> by which we are bound, <hi>not to offend a brother, that is truly weak.</hi> But yet things, which are in there own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, when they are either forbidden, or commanded by lawful authority, are now no longer indifferent, to thoſe, which are under that authority during the time, that they are ſo forbidden, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thy brother be grieved] i. e.</hi> If thy brother be ſo far <hi>troubled,</hi> with thy eating thoſe things, which are forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as that he thinks to his <hi>grief,</hi> that thou diſpiſeſt the Law of God, which was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who yet wouldſt be accounted a Servant of God: Or that he is in a manner <hi>forced</hi> by thy <hi>example</hi> to eat againſt his <hi>conſcience,</hi> and ſo to his <hi>grief,</hi> thoſe things which he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his conſcience (though falſly) cannot lawfully be eaten: Or is any other way grieved with the meat, that he ſeeth the eat, and with thy eating of it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We may ſay, that <hi>to be grieved,</hi> here, is as much as <hi>to be offended, or to ſtumble or fall</hi> by occaſion given. For <hi>they which ſtumble, and fall,</hi> and ſo come by hurt <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>For whom Chriſt died]</hi> This is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and feelingly ſpoken. And this doth aggravate the ſin of him which eats, with the ſcandal and offence of his brother; when as his brother is conſidered, as ſuch an one, as for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>Let not then your good be evil
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59465:166"/> ſpoken of]</hi> That is, Do not ye then ſo uſe your Chriſtian liberty (which is a great <hi>good,</hi> which you have received by Chriſt, and an <hi>eaſe</hi> from a hard <hi>yoke</hi>) as that your weak brethren, ſhould ſo much as defame it, and ſpeak evil of it, through you.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks here to the faithfull <hi>Jews,</hi> which believed in Chriſt, and the <hi>ſtronger</hi> ſort of them, and by their <hi>good,</hi> he meaneth their <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> which they had by Chriſt (who by his death ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi>) in eating any kind of meats without difference: Which <hi>liberty</hi> he calls <hi>their good,</hi> becauſe by that they were delivered from a <hi>great evil</hi> (I ſpeak not evill of ſin) That is, from a great <hi>yoke,</hi> or <hi>burden</hi> of the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This good is evill ſpoken</hi> of, when it is called by weak brethren, who are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the abrogation <hi>of Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Sin, Abomination, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> the <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of the fleſh,</hi> the <hi>indulgency and cockering of the Gorge,</hi> the <hi>Patent or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of gluttony,</hi> and the like, which terms the weak brethren would be ready to give it, if they ſhould ſee the <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger Jews</hi> uſing this liberty freely before their eyes.

               </p>
               <p>Ver. 17. <hi>For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink]</hi> The Apoſtle prevents another objection here; for the <hi>ſtrong</hi> in faith might ſay: yea, but I may juſtly <hi>fear</hi> that God will be <hi>angry</hi> with me, and good men would <hi>blame</hi> me, if I ſhould not make <hi>uſe of that liberty,</hi> which Chriſt hath purchaſed for me; and I may fear that I ſhould not <hi>advance</hi> the Kingdom of God, as I ought to do, if I ſhould neglect to <hi>exerciſe,</hi> ſo great a grace of Chriſtianity, as this our <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> is.

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>We then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak]</hi> The Apoſtle having in the former Chapter, inſtructed the <hi>Chriſtian Jew</hi> which is <hi>ſtrong</hi> in the faith, how he ſhould carry himſelf to the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Jew</hi> which is <hi>weak,</hi> turns his ſpeech here from him to the <hi>ſtrong Chriſtian in general,</hi> whether he be Jew, or whether he be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, by an <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> and whereas he ſpake in the former Chapter, and treated there of ſuch <hi>days</hi> and ſuch <hi>meats only,</hi> as had been differenced by the <hi>Law of Moſes:</hi> Here he ſpeaks of all things, which are any waies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced by the opinion of men. He ſpeaks here I ſay, in general to the ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whether he be <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> and inſtructs the <hi>ſtrong Jew</hi> how he ſhould carry himſelf to a <hi>weak Gentile;</hi> and a <hi>ſtrong Gentile</hi> how he ſhould carry himſelf to a <hi>weak Jew;</hi> and this he ſeems to do eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though a ſtrong Gentile may alſo learn from hence, how to carry himſelf to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, which is weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak]</hi> This is inferred from the laſt verſe of the fourteenth Chapter, for it is a general truth which he there ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that he <hi>that doubteth is damned if he eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he eateth not of faith: for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> Or rather it is inferred from thoſe words of the 21 verſ. <hi>It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother ſtumbleth, or is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, or is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We that are ſtrong]</hi> Thoſe he calls <hi>ſtrong</hi> here, which are <hi>strong in faith,</hi> that is, which are ſo well skilled and ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, of the lawful uſe of things which are indifferent in their own nature, as that they can uſe them without <hi>ſcruple</hi> or <hi>doubt of conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ought to bear the infirmities of the weak]</hi> Thoſe he calls <hi>weak</hi> here, which are <hi>weak in faith,</hi> as he ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. that is, ſuch as have not attained to ſo much knowledge, as to know what they may lawfully do, or what they may lawfully leave undone, in ſuch things as are in their own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and are ſoon offended at other mens doings in ſuch matters. And this their <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>aptneſs to be offended,</hi> he alſo calls their <hi>infirmity</hi> or <hi>weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then do the <hi>ſtrong</hi> bear the infirmity of the <hi>weak,</hi> when they patiently ſuffer them in things indifferent, and do not raſhly, or unadviſedly contradict them; when they avoid all means and occaſions of offending them: And when, as they have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they do meekly <hi>inſtruct</hi> them, and wiſely <hi>inform</hi> them concerning things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> that they may come to the right knowledge thereof, and may be confirmed in the <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words <hi>To bear the infirmity of the weak,</hi> the Apoſtle uſeth a <hi>Metaphor</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from fellow travellers, where the <hi>ſtronger</hi> and beſt able to travel, will help the weakeſt and leſs able, to carry part of his <hi>burden</hi> or <hi>pack.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To pleaſe our ſelves</hi> therefore ſignifieth here by a <hi>Syllepſis</hi> or a <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> ſo to pleaſe our ſelves in our doings (which we may as well not do) as to offend another,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59465:170"/> and be an occaſion to him of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour, for his good to edification] i. e.</hi> Let every one of us, whether Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, do that which is pleaſing to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whether he be Jew or Gentile, and comply with him for his good to edification, though by ſo doing, we do contrary to our own humor or phanſie.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle would have us to <hi>pleaſe our neighbour</hi> as well as our ſelves, that is, not to offend him, but to comply with him; but yet he would not have us to pleaſe him, and comply with him in any <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> matter. And therefore he adds here, <hi>to his good to edification</hi> The chief things which he would have us here to pleaſe him in, are things indifferent in their own nature, in the uſe of which he would not have us to croſs him, ſo as to offend him, or to make him ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To his good]</hi> By his good he means his ſpiritual good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To edification] i. e.</hi> That he may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by edified.</p>
               <p>Concerning the meaning of the word <hi>Edification,</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>For even Chriſt pleaſed not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf] i. e.</hi> For even Chriſt (who ought to be our pattern, and whom we ought to imitate) though he were Lord of all, yet did he do that which was grievous to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and diſpleaſing to that, that he might ſave others, and ſo do that which was wel-pleaſing to them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The reproaches of them which reproached thee, fell on me] i. e.</hi> The puniſhment due to them which reproached thee, for thoſe their reproaches, fell on me, <hi>Supple,</hi> and they fell on me, not <hi>againſt my will,</hi> but with <hi>my will,</hi> yea, I <hi>willingly</hi> took them upon my ſelf, that I might ſatisfie thee, for thoſe their ſins.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of theſe words, as the Apoſtle here uſeth them, and it is the <hi>end</hi> (which is here left to be underſtood) and the <hi>manner of Chriſts</hi> taking upon him the puniſhment due to the reproaches, of thoſe ſinners that reproached God, which brings this authority up to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reproaches] i. e.</hi> The puniſhments due to the Reproachers. <hi>Metonymie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of them which reproached thee] i. e.</hi> Of thoſe ſinners which reproached thee, O God, by their words and by their actions: For every ſin, whether it be in word, or in deed, is a reproach to God, againſt whoſe Law they ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fell on me] i. e.</hi> Fell on me, who yet was willing to bear them, yea, who did willingly take them upon me, and undergo them, that I might ſatisfie thy Juſtice for them, and ſo ſet them free.</p>
               <p>Who ſees not here, that Chriſt did that which was not pleaſing to his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it ſelf, but that which was pleaſing to others: For to whom is it not pleaſing, that Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie for his ſins, that he might eſcape the puniſhment due to them, and ſo be ſaved? And how would it be otherwiſe than grievous to the humane nature of Chriſt, in which he ſuffered, to ſuffer ſuch pains as he ſuffered, and ſo be diſpleaſing to that.</p>
               <p>But note here, that theſe words as they lie in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.9. are in the <hi>firſt ſence</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>David,</hi> who complains there to God of his afflictions, and how he was grieved to ſee and hear his enemies, ſo to reproach him the living God, as they did: And the ſence of theſe words as they are thus ſpoken by <hi>David,</hi> is this; <hi>And the reproaches of them which reproached thee, fell on me, to the wounding of my Soul, to think that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo reproached.</hi> That is: <hi>And I was grieved at the heart to hear men reproach thee, as they did, and took it as grieuouſly as if they had reproached me my ſelf.</hi> But in the <hi>ſecond and ſublime ſence,</hi> they are to be underſtood as the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and bear the ſame ſence, as we at the firſt gave of them. For note, that <hi>David</hi> was a type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> ſufferings of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings, wherefore many things which are ſpoken of <hi>David,</hi> in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> ſence; are to be underſtoood of Chriſt in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſence, and many words which are ſpoken by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> are to be underſtood as ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo, but yet not always in <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> ſence, the Holy Ghoſt ſo fitting the words, as that they may be ſpoken as well by the <hi>one</hi> as the <hi>other,</hi> in their ſeveral ſences: But of this ſee what I ſaid in my Preface to my Expoſition on the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The reproaches of them which reproached thee, fell on me]</hi> It had been more congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the context here, for the Apoſtle to have ſaid, <hi>The reproaches of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached God, fell on him:</hi> But, as I have obſerved before, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> when he quotes any authority out of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> or the

               <p>Some ask the <hi>Queſtion</hi> here, why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle brings this teſtimony here, when he had more plain teſtimonies for his purpoſe, as that of <hi>Iſaiah Iſa.</hi> 53.4. <hi>He that hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this: I conceive that the Apoſtle made choice of this teſtimony here, becauſe it mentioneth <hi>reproaches</hi> expreſly, and <hi>reproaches</hi> were the chiefeſt fault, which he had to complain of in the <hi>Romans,</hi> which if they had patiently born at the hands of one another, there had not been thoſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> and <hi>diſcords</hi> among them, as were: For the <hi>weak</hi> judged the <hi>ſtrong</hi> as a ſinner in what he did, and the <hi>ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The mercy which God vouchſafed the Gentiles was, that though he ſent not his Son Chriſt Jeſus to them in perſon, as he did to the Jews, yet he ſent his Apoſtles and Miniſters to them with the fullneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Note that what <hi>God</hi> did for the <hi>Jews,</hi> in ſending <hi>Chriſt</hi> to them is ſaid to be for the <hi>truth of God,</hi> and <hi>for his promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. But what he did for the <hi>Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Why Gods people <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould rejoyce here, it is clear, to wit, becauſe after the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Captivity,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> from them which perſecuted them: But now why ſhould the <hi>Gentiles</hi> rejoyce with his people?

               <p>I doubt not but that <hi>Moſes</hi> propheſieth here chiefly of the miſeries and captivities which the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Sennacharib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and under <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> and the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> which were meer hunters of men; and ſo oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, but all <hi>other people</hi> that they could reach; When therefore the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſword and captivity of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo were delivered, and by reaſon of that <hi>delivery they</hi> had reaſon to rejoyce, as well as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 14. <hi>verſe</hi> 6.7. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <hi>Some,</hi> think that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this his <hi>Metaphor</hi> alludes to the <hi>ſacrifices of Beaſts,</hi> which were uſed in the Law for <hi>burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as he alludes to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Others,</hi> think that he alludes not to the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Beaſts,</hi> but to the <hi>meat-offerings</hi> of which we read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. And that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes further in this to thoſe words of the Prophet Iſaiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.20. <hi>And they ſhall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord, out of all Nations upon horſes, &amp;c. as the Children of Iſrael bring an offering in a clean Veſſel into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And that he in thoſe words, <hi>Being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> alludeth <hi>particularly</hi> to the <hi>Salt which was uſed in the meat offerings.</hi> For <hi>no meat offering was to be without Salt, Levit.</hi> 2.13 And indeed the <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> may be many ways reſembled or liken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>ſalt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſie to <hi>interpret</hi> the word, either one way or other of theſe <hi>two,</hi> by what I have ſaid, and I leave my Reader to his <hi>choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks here in this verſe under a <hi>metaphor</hi> being <hi>Strip'd</hi> of the metaphor is in plain terms this, q. d. <hi>That I ſhould be an Apoſtle of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle prevents an objection here. For whereas he ſaid that Grace was given to him of God, that he ſhould be the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Jeſus Chriſt to the Gentiles, &amp;c. A Roman might object and ſay. But if it be ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> that thou haſt Grace given thee of God that thou ſhouldſt be a Miniſter of God to the Gentiles, why doſt not thou make uſe of this Grace? For thou never cameſt to us Romans, who are Gentiles to miniſter the Goſpel to us, &amp;c. Thou letteſt this Grace therefore to lie idle. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the Apoſtle prevents ſaying. I have therefore whereof I may glory, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Therefore</hi> is not an illative here, but a continuative, not ſignifying the <hi>Illation</hi> of any thing from that which went before, but <hi>continuing</hi> only the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeech, and ſignifieth as much as <hi>And,</hi> or <hi>Now,</hi> or <hi>And now.</hi>

               <p>Theſe words <hi>[I will not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things which Christ hath not wrought by me]</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks thus, that they may not think, that what he ſpeaks, he ſpeaks out of <hi>vain-glory,</hi> and that they may therefore give the word <hi>credit</hi> to what he ſpeaks.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And yet me thinks there is ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> that the Apoſtle aims at, in <hi>this word</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> That is, <hi>So that I have fully preached the Goſpel,</hi> not <hi>onely</hi> of that, that <hi>he preached the Goſpel,</hi> and all the myſteries thereof in all thoſe places, but alſo that he preached them <hi>effectually,</hi> ſo that they were <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by all, that dwelt there.</p>
               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Yea, ſo have I ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, not wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re Chriſt was named,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>i. e.</hi> Yea, I have with a kind of ambition ſtrived and choſen to preach the Goſpel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, to wit, <hi>in word and deed with ſigns and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, not in thoſe places where Chriſt was named;</hi> leſt I ſhould build upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Foundation: But in thoſe places where Chriſt was not ſo much as named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo that, that which is written, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>connexion</hi> of this with the <hi>former</hi> verſe the <hi>Apoſtle prevents</hi> an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here. For whereas he had ſaid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe that <hi>he had fully preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt from Hieruſalem to Illyricum,</hi> it might be objected that that was no great matter for him to do, or glory of; For it might be that <hi>others</hi> had preached there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and inſtructed them in the knowledge of the Goſpel. This objection the Apoſtle prevents ſaying: <hi>Yea, ſo have I ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but where he was never</hi> ſo much as <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So have I ſtrived to preach the Goſpel]</hi> This particle <hi>ſo</hi> relates not to that word <hi>ſtrived</hi> but to that word <hi>Preach, q. d. Yea I have ſtrived to preach the Goſpel ſo.</hi> And this particle <hi>ſo</hi> ſignifies <hi>after that manner,</hi> that is, <hi>after that manner,</hi> to wit, <hi>that he had ſpoke of,</hi> that is, <hi>by word and deed through mighty ſigns and wonders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Have I ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named,</hi> &amp;c.] By theſe words the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſheweth with how great deſire he deſired to excerciſe his <hi>Apoſtolical fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and to preach where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>never</hi> preached before, and that he made it as it were his Ambition, ſo to do. And he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth alſo hereby, that the Goſpel was never preached (before he preached it) in the places between <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Illyriam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why did the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſo much deſire to preach where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was never named, that is, where Chriſt had never been preached before?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He might do it <hi>firſt</hi> out of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> for being that the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, it is more <hi>charity</hi> to preach the Goſpel, where it was never preached before, than to preach there, where it had been preached before, and where the foundation of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had been laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He might deſire this, becauſe to preach the Goſpel, where it had been never preached before, is more proper for an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (ſuch a one as <hi>Paul</hi> was) then to preach, where it had been preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for to <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>lay the foundation of Churches,</hi> is the proper and peculiar work of an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apoſtle might deſire this, that he might have whereof to <hi>glory</hi> againſt <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> or at leaſt, that <hi>falſe Apostles</hi> might not have whereof to <hi>glory,</hi> ſo much as in ſhew againſt him. For <hi>falſe Apoſtles</hi> would ſeem <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and boaſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they were <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> though they built, and that unskilfully too, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own, but upon <hi>another</hi> mans <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> that is, though they preached where <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been preached before, and when they preached, they preached <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>vanities</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſound</hi> doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſt I ſhould build upon another mans foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation] i. e.</hi> Leſt I ſhould have preached the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them, to whom it had been
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59465:176"/> preached by others, before.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>foundation</hi> he means here the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential points of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and by <hi>building thereupon,</hi> he meaneth <hi>preaching there, where they had been preached before.</hi>

               <p>Upon what account they are their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to relieve them in their neceſſities, he tells in the next words.</p>

               <p>It is not <hi>Dubitantis</hi> but <hi>Affirmantis</hi> here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſpiritual things,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſpeaks of, are ſuch things as conduced to a <hi>ſpiritual life,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is, the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith here, that <hi>the Gentiles which received the Goſpel and the Sacraments from the Jews, were debtors to the Jews,</hi> and bound to them (by reaſon of the Goſpel, and the Sacraments which they received from them) to relieve them, in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: And ſpeaks not of thoſe <hi>Jews only</hi> which <hi>preached</hi> the Goſpel, and <hi>miniſtred</hi> the Sacraments to them, which were the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but of as many of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> (from which they came out) as were Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>I commend unto you Phaebe our ſiſter]</hi> He calls <hi>Phaebe his Siſter,</hi> or <hi>their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> not becauſe ſhe was <hi>ſo</hi> by reaſon of <hi>alliance of blood,</hi> but becauſe ſhe was ſo by reaſon of <hi>the common faith,</hi> and by <hi>reaſon of Religion,</hi> for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> called all men that were of the <hi>ſame Religion</hi> and embraced the ſame <hi>faith</hi> with them, <hi>Brethren,</hi> and women, <hi>Siſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we commend any perſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is for that, that they to whom we commend him, may ſhew ſome courteſie to the perſon commended; Now what courteſie it was that <hi>Paul</hi> deſired of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Phaebe</hi> is expreſſed in the next verſe: It is, <hi>that they would receive her in the Lord as becometh Saints, and that they would aſſiſt her, in whatſoever buſineſs ſhe ſhould have need of them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Which is a ſervant of the Church, &amp;c.]</hi> There were in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times <hi>women</hi> choſen as well as <hi>men</hi> to do ſervice in the Church (but not in things immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to God) called <hi>Deaconneſſes,</hi> which were appointed to have a <hi>care</hi> of the poor members of the Church, and eſpecially of thoſe which were <hi>ſick,</hi> &amp;c. Such Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.9. Some think that this <hi>Phaebe</hi> was ſuch a one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called here <hi>a Servant of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But others think, and not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, otherwiſe; for that ſhe is ſuppoſed to have been a <hi>Rich woman,</hi> and a woman of a <hi>noble birth:</hi> ſhe is called therefore <hi>a ſervant of the Church,</hi> as they ſay, in that ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly did many good ſervices of her own free bounty, for the Church in relieving the <hi>poor</hi> diſtreſſed members thereof, and doing for all, what they ſtood in need of, to her power.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>That ye receive her] i. e.</hi> That ye receive her in to your houſes and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And that ye aſſiſt her] i. e.</hi> And that ye ſtand by her, and help her.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Aſist</hi> or <hi>ſtand by one,</hi> is to help him; And it is, as ſome think, a <hi>millitary</hi> word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As becometh Saints]</hi> This phraſe may be underſtood as well of them which <hi>receive,</hi> as of thoſe which are <hi>received.</hi> For they which <hi>receive</hi> muſt carry themſelves ſo as it <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Saints:</hi> and they which are received are to be entertained ſo, as that it may appear, that they are accounted of, as <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Lord.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>She hath been a ſuccouror of many]</hi> She might be a <hi>ſuccouror</hi> of many, by <hi>ſtanding</hi> between them and dangers; and defending them protecting them, and procuring them ſafety, when any <hi>ſtorms</hi> aroſe againſt them. As alſo by <hi>entertaining</hi> them in her houſe, and <hi>harbouring</hi> them hoſpitably, when they were <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and means fell out to be <hi>ſhort</hi> with them.</p>

                  <hi>Greet Priſcilla and Aquila,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>i. e. Salute Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> in my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſalutation</hi> is a <hi>ſignification of our love,</hi> whereby we wiſh all temporal and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual welfare to Him, whom we <hi>ſalute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we <hi>deſire</hi> one another to <hi>ſalute</hi> a third perſon in our name, it is to deſire him to ſignifie to that third perſon, our wiſhes of his temporal and ſpiritual welfare.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth deſire many here to be <hi>ſaluted</hi> in his name, and this he doth, that by his <hi>courteſie,</hi> he may win them to <hi>reſpect</hi> him and his Doctrine the more; and that he might receive the better <hi>welcome</hi> from them, when he cometh among them. Or he may do it, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might take the more notice of them, whom he deſires to be <hi>ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and give them the more <hi>reſpect</hi> for his <hi>ſalutation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priſcilla and Aquila] Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi> were both Jews; And <hi>Priſcilla</hi> was the wife; <hi>Aquila</hi> the husband; ſome ask therefore why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth name <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla</hi> here before <hi>Aquila,</hi> the <hi>wife</hi> before
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59465:181"/> the <hi>husband?</hi> And they anſwer, that it was, becauſe <hi>Priſcilla</hi> did believe and became a Chriſtian before her <hi>Husband;</hi> And <hi>grace</hi> is to be preferred in order, before <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though <hi>Priſcilla</hi> be named here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aquila,</hi> yet <hi>Aquila</hi> is named before <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My helpers in Chriſt Jeſus]</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls theſe, <hi>his helpers in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were an <hi>help</hi> to him in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery</hi> and propagation of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How in particular theſe were Saint <hi>Pauls helpers</hi> in the Miniſtery or propagation of the Goſpel, is not here expreſſed: but we read of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> that they took <hi>Apollos</hi> to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. whereby they might <hi>help</hi> this way, in the converſion of others.</p>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>Who have for my life laid down their own necks] i. e.</hi> Who have ventured their own lives, to preſerve mine, and free me out of danger.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> when he ſaith here <hi>that they have laid down their own necks,</hi> meaning thereby, that they ran the hazard of their lives, ſeems to allude to the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who <hi>chopt of their necks</hi> with an ax, which were condemned to <hi>die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in that which he ſays here, ſeems to have an eye upon the danger in which he was in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.12. when an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> was made againſt him with one accord at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and they brought him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement ſeat, <hi>Gallio</hi> being deputy of <hi>Achaia.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom not onely I give thanks]</hi> To wit, for that their love, in preſerving my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But alſo all the Churches of the Gentiles]</hi> The Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might all of them give thanks to <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> for preſerving the life of <hi>Paul</hi> out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; becauſe that <hi>Paul</hi> was the common <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the benefit of the preſevation of his life, redounded to them all.</p>
               <p>There may be an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in theſe words, and by <hi>all the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> may be meant, not <hi>all</hi> in general, but only <hi>all thoſe Churches of the Gentiles which were about Corinth,</hi> who knew of this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Likewiſe greet the Church that is in their houſe] The Church</hi> is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a narrow ſence, for the members of any <hi>family</hi> or <hi>houſhold</hi> which are <hi>believers,</hi> of which <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, and profeſs his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and ſo ſurely it is taken here. So that the ſence of this place is this: <hi>Likewiſe greet thoſe of their houſhold who believe in Chriſt, and have given their name to him.</hi> In this ſence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the ſaints ſalute you, chiefly they that are of Caeſars houſhold, Phil.</hi> 4.22. where he might have called the <hi>ſaints</hi> which are of <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold, the <hi>Church</hi> which were in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold, as he doth here the <hi>ſaints</hi> of the houſhold of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> in their houſe, for it is all one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church] i. e.</hi> The ſaints and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful which are members of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here is therefore a <hi>Synechdoche generis</hi> in the word <hi>Church,</hi> as it is here uſed, where the whole <hi>Church</hi> is put for a <hi>part,</hi> or for <hi>ſome</hi> members only of the <hi>Church.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle uſeth a <hi>Metaphor</hi> here, and alludes therein to that Ceremonial Law of <hi>offering the firſt fruits,</hi> of which we ſaid ſomething, <hi>Chapter</hi> 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Note, that for <hi>Achaia</hi> many books read <hi>Aſia, q. d. Epenetus, who is the firſt fruits of Aſia unto Chriſt.</hi> And then <hi>Epenetus</hi> may be ſo called, becauſe he was the <hi>very firſt</hi> which believed in <hi>Aſia;</hi> otherwiſe if we read in <hi>Achaia,</hi> he muſt be interpreted to be but <hi>one of the firſt,</hi> not <hi>the very firſt.</hi> For 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Stephanus</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>the firſt fruits of Achaia too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Who beſtowed much labour on us]</hi> What this labour was the Apoſtle tells not, though we may think, that it was ſome ſuch labour as did make him more <hi>expedite</hi> to preach the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
